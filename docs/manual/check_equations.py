"""Measure every numbered equation against the column it is typeset in (WP-1408).

    .venv/bin/python -m pip install playwright     # once, see below
    .venv/bin/python docs/manual/check_equations.py

`make_screenshots.py`'s rule applied to a *measurement* rather than a picture.
The manual's equation numbers are placed by CSS and their equations by MathJax
in the browser, so how wide an equation is, and whether it collides with its own
number, is not a fact any source file holds. This script is the one authority
for how that was measured; it prints a row per labelled equation and exits
non-zero when one does not fit.

**playwright is deliberately not a dependency.** It is not in `[dev]`, only this
script and `make_screenshots.py` want it, and the docs build never runs either.
The chromium it drives is resolved by `make_screenshots.chromium_path()` — the
cached build on a machine that has run a browser pass before, or
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM`.

**What the numbers mean.** Furo pins the equation number with
`position: absolute; right: .5rem`, over the page's fixed-width content column,
and `basic.css` floats it; neither reserves space, so before WP-1408 a wide
equation was typeset *under* its own number. `_static/custom.css` now lays a
numbered equation out as a two-cell grid, which makes the collision impossible
and turns the remaining question into a width: does the typeset math fit the
cell the grid gives it? So each row carries

* `ink` — the `mjx-math` box, the equation's actual typeset width;
* `cell` — the client width of the `mjx-container` it sits in;
* `clear` — the gap from the ink's right edge to the number's left edge;
* `over` — how far the ink overflows the cell, i.e. how far it scrolls.

A failing row is fixed by **reflowing the equation** (`aligned`, `split`, or
naming a sub-expression once), never by narrowing the number's column: the
reader reads the equation, and a horizontal scrollbar in the middle of a
derivation is a defect with a scrollbar on it.

Measured at two viewport widths because the failure is width-dependent in
principle. In practice Furo caps the content column, so both report the same
numbers, and a run that disagrees between them has found something new.
