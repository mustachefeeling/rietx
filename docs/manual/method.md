# Reading a paper against its own numbers

Every equation in this manual was transcribed from a source that could be —
and in the cases below, was — wrong in print. This chapter records four
worked examples of the house method: validate an implementation against the
*defining* quantity (an integral, an identity, a limit), never against a
transcription of the result; and when a paper disagrees with itself, find
the reading its own numbers pin down.

## Rouse b₂: validate against the integral

The capillary-absorption fit {eq}`corr-rouse` has four coefficients
{cite}`rouse1970`. The available scan of the paper prints $b_2$ as
"−0·0375" — a digit transposition of the true −0.3750. The error is
invisible against the $\sin^2\theta = 0$ column of the paper's own table
(which constrains only $a_1$ and $a_2$) and small at low $\mu R$, but it is
0.0821 wrong at $\mu R = 1$. What settles it is a quadrature of the
defining volume-average integral ({cite}`itc-c` eq. 6.3.3.4): with −0.3750
the maximum error over the whole domain is 0.0035 — exactly the bound the
paper claims for its fit. Never validate an absorption expression on a
constant-θ slice.

The same discipline is structural for the flat-plate cases: they are
closed-form integrals rather than fits, so the tests check them against an
adaptive quadrature of the defining path-length integral, sharing no
constant with the implementation.

## Two Coelho papers vs. their own tables

**Coelho (2005), eq. (1)** {cite}`coelho2005` prints the early-iteration
damping factor as $\mathrm{Max}[(k+1)/N_k,\, 1]$ while the surrounding text
describes a *reduction* — which would be Min. Measured on real refinements,
neither reading helps once parameter removal shrinks $N_k$ (the printed Max
form then actively degrades the step), and the shipped factor is 1, kept as
a selectable option because it was measured rather than argued.

**Coelho (2018), eq. (9)** {cite}`coelho2018` defines the predicted cost
change as $\Delta S_t = \Delta p^\top b$. Taken literally with the paper's
own $b = -J^\top r$, that is *positive* for a descent step while $\Delta S
< 0$, so every good step would report $r_u = \Delta S_t/\Delta S < 0$ —
contradicting the paper's own Table 1 ($r_u \approx 1.003$ on a
near-quadratic step), its §1.2 statement, and its Fig. 10 distribution. The
self-consistent reading is

```{math}
:label: meth-dst

\Delta S_t \;=\; -\Delta\theta^\top b,
```

pinned by an identity: on an exactly linear model the Gauss-Newton step
gives $r_u \equiv 1$, which is the calibration test — and the only way to
know the λ schedule is being fed the quantity its published constants were
tuned for.

## The FCJ corner: the parameterisation stalls, not the solver

The FCJ quadrature ({eq}`prof-fcj-weight`) is built around $|s - h|$ and
$\min(s, h)$, both non-differentiable at $s = h$ — and the default
instrument starts both apertures equal {cite}`finger1994`. Measured on the
SRM 660c protocol: the analytic $S/L$ and $H/L$ Jacobian columns agree with
a residual-vector finite difference to only ~2 % (every other column is
≤ 1e-5), because the analytic derivative is one-sided while the central
difference straddles the corner. At $s = h$ the two columns are then
*identical*: a Gauss-Newton step moves the pair along the diagonal forever,
the correlation guard reports ρ = +1.000, the bounded LM converges with the
pair still bit-identical, and TRF escapes onto an asymmetric solution only
by way of its own internal scaling. Neither escape is principled. When two
drivers "disagree" like this, the finding is not that one solver is better
— it is that the parameterisation owns a corner nobody's step can see
across.

## µR, µt, and why ΔRwp judges none of this

Capillary absorption {eq}`corr-rouse` factors *exactly* into a scale times
a Debye-Waller shape: applied to a model with free scale and displacement
parameters, Rwp provably cannot move (measured: 3×10⁻⁸ on real 11-BM data),
while every Biso shifts by exactly the predicted {eq}`corr-deltab`. The
correction is real physics with zero fit-quality signature. Flat-plate µt
is the same story with the degeneracy only approximate — 3–47 % of its
signature survives the projection — so it *does* move Rwp, and on a
genuinely thick specimen declaring a thickness moves it the *wrong way*,
which is how you learn the specimen was not thin.

Of the eight corrections shipped in one release, not one is well judged by
ΔRwp: two provably cannot move it, one moves it the wrong way when it is
right, three move it while changing nothing quotable, and the two largest
accuracy wins (dispersion taking round-robin QPA from RMS 2.26 to
0.69 wt %; absorption unbiasing ADPs by up to 1.5 Å²) are invisible in it.
That is why every correction ships with a record field or diagnostic
stating what it changed — and why this manual quotes those fields rather
than Rwp comparisons as evidence.
