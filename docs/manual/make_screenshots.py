"""Regenerate the GUI chapters' committed screenshots (WP-1017).

    .venv/bin/python -m pip install playwright     # once, see below
    .venv/bin/python docs/manual/make_screenshots.py

`make_figures.py`'s rule, one medium over: the screenshots are **committed**,
not built, so the sphinx build stays offline and dependency-free, and this
script is the one authority for how each was taken.  The cost is that a
screenshot can go stale when a control moves, so `SHOTS` below is the
*declared* set and `tests/test_gui_manual.py` fails on a chapter referencing a
picture this script does not produce — which is what makes a moved control a
stale picture the build can name rather than one a reader finds.

**playwright is deliberately not a dependency.**  It is not in `[dev]`, this
script is the only thing that wants it, and a docs build never runs it.  The
chromium it drives is whatever `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM` names, defaulting to the
newest build in playwright's own cache: on a machine that has run a browser
pass before, the binaries are already there, and a revision mismatch with the
installed `playwright` package is not a reason to download a second copy
(`gui/CLAUDE.md`, "Driving a real browser").

**Every shot is of a real project**, never a mock.  The server is the real one,
booted in-process on a thread the way `tests/test_gui_server.py` boots it, and
it starts with **no project** — so the empty state is photographed as a first
run of the app actually finds it, and the project is then opened through the
same route the example row calls.  A fitted shot runs the plan first, so the
curves in the picture are curves the package produced.

Each shot is written twice, `-light` and `-dark`, and the chapters select
between them with furo's `only-light` / `only-dark` classes, exactly as
Part 1's figures do.  A single white-ground screenshot on a dark page is what
that avoids.
