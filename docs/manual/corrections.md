# Intensity corrections

Each correction in this chapter multiplies the reflection intensity of
{eq}`fm-rietveld`. None of the corrections in this chapter is well judged by
$\Delta R_{wp}$. One provably cannot move it (capillary absorption, an exact
reparameterisation). One moves it the wrong way when it is right (a declared
flat-plate thickness on a thick specimen). The largest accuracy wins are
invisible in it: dispersion on quantitative fractions, absorption on ADPs. Every
correction therefore reports what it changed through a record field or a
diagnostic, as {ref}`ch-method` describes.

## Lorentz-polarisation

```{math}
:label: corr-lp

\mathrm{Lp}(\theta) \;=\;
\frac{K + (1 - K)\cos^2 2\theta}{\sin^2\theta\, \cos\theta}.
```

{source}`rietx.model.corrections.lorentz_polarization`

The $1/(\sin^2\theta \cos\theta)$ Lorentz part is the standard
constant-wavelength powder factor (single-crystal rotation Lorentz × powder
ring statistics; {cite}`itc-c` §6.2, {cite}`klug1974`). $K$ is the fraction of
the beam polarised perpendicular to the diffraction plane ($\sigma$-polarised).
$K = 0.5$ reproduces the unpolarised $(1 + \cos^2 2\theta)/2$, and a synchrotron
beam diffracting in the vertical plane has $K \approx 0.99$. A diffracted-beam
monochromator sets $K = 1/(1 + \cos^2 2\theta_m)$ {cite}`itc-c,azaroff1955`. The
familiar 26.6° there is a Cu number and not a property of the graphite
crystal.

### The time-of-flight Lorentz factor

A bank that separates reflections by arrival time rather than by angle has a
different Lorentz factor, and it is not {eq}`corr-lp` with a substitution
{cite}`larson2004`:

```{math}
:label: corr-lorentz-tof

L_{\text{TOF}} \;=\; d^{4} \sin\theta_{\text{bank}} .
```

{source}`rietx.model.forward_tof.CompiledTOFModel.lorentz`

Two things about it are easy to get wrong. The angle is the bank's, fixed,
the same for every reflection in the histogram, not a per-reflection $\theta$,
so on a single bank $\sin\theta_{\text{bank}}$ is exactly degenerate with
the phase scale, and it earns its place only across the banks of one
instrument, where the ratio is what lets one set of scales fit all of them.
And the $d^4$ is steep: over the decade in $d$ a bank typically covers it
spans four orders of magnitude, which is why an error of one in the exponent
shows up as a wrong $B_{\text{iso}}$ long before it shows up as a wrong cell.
$K = 1$ on this arm as on every neutron source, so no polarisation factor
multiplies it.

## The incident spectrum of a time-of-flight bank

A white beam delivers a different number of neutrons at every flight time, so
a histogram that has not been divided by a vanadium measurement carries the
moderator's own output as a smooth envelope over its Bragg peaks. GSAS records
that envelope in an instrument-parameter file: the `ITYP` record says which of
five functions was fitted to it, the `ICOFF` block carries the coefficients
{cite}`larson2004`. Type 1 (the one two of the three real files reached here
declare) is a sum of exponentials of the flight time $T$ in
milliseconds:

```{math}
:label: corr-ityp1

I_i(T) \;=\; P_1 \;+\; \sum_{k=1}^{5} P_{2k}\,
              \exp\!\left(-P_{2k+1}\,T^{k}\right)
```

{source}`rietx.model.tof_spectrum.incident_spectrum`

with type 2 replacing the $k=1$ term by a Maxwellian
$P_2\exp(-P_3/T^2)/T^5$, and types 3–5 twelve-term Chebyshev polynomials of
the first kind in $X = 2/T - 1$ (or $X = T/10$ for type 5). The millisecond is
the trap: everything else on this arm is microseconds, and in µs the
Chebyshev argument leaves its orthogonal range by three orders.

Whether a file carries one is a fact about the file and not about the
technique. ISIS GEM writes `ITYP 0` on all six banks (no spectrum, because
its reduction already divided by vanadium), and so do the Mantid reductions
POWGEN and NOMAD use; a LANSCE-style file writes `ITYP 1` with a full `ICOFF`
block, and its data still carries the envelope. `ITYP 0` is the default, and a
bank that declares it multiplies by nothing at all.

Where the factor goes differs from GSAS deliberately. GSAS divides the
observed counts by $I_i$ and the channel width; `rietx` leaves the data as
the file gave it and multiplies the calculated Bragg intensity instead, per
channel, so every weight stays the data's own $\sigma$ and $R_{wp}$ is
computed against counts a person can go and look at. The background takes no
factor: it is fitted in the observed space, so whatever the spectrum does to it
is already in the coefficients the background refines.

Leave the coefficients held. A smooth envelope in $\lambda$ and an isotropic
displacement parameter are the same shape (that degeneracy is exactly why the
correction has to be *right* rather than merely flexible), so freeing them
against an unknown structure moves $B_{\text{iso}}$ rather than measuring the
spectrum. Freeing them on a standard, where $B_{\text{iso}}$ is known, is how
the file's own calibration gets checked.

## Attenuation coefficients

Specimen absorption needs $\mu$, computed from the refined cell contents
and the McMaster total cross sections {cite}`mcmaster1969`:

```{math}
:label: corr-mu

\mu\ [\mathrm{cm}^{-1}] \;=\;
\sum_{\mathrm{atoms}} \mathrm{occ}\cdot m \cdot
\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{tot}}\ [\mathrm{barn}]}{V\ [\text{Å}^3]}
```

{source}`rietx.crystallography.attenuation.linear_attenuation`

(1 barn = 10⁻²⁴ cm² and 1 Å³ = 10⁻²⁴ cm³, so the exponents cancel).
Attenuation means beam removal, so the total cross section is the one used,
coherent and incoherent scattering included. That is the NIST convention
{cite}`hubbell1995`. The tabulation is a ~2 %-spaced logarithmic grid that
cannot represent an absorption edge, so an interval containing an edge raises an
error instead of being interpolated. A wavelength that close above an edge also
means strong fluorescence, and a refusal is more honest than any number.

## Capillary (cylindrical) absorption

The transmission coefficient is the volume average of the attenuation
({cite}`itc-c` eq. 6.3.3.1),

```{math}
:label: corr-itc

A \;=\; \frac{1}{V} \int_V e^{-\mu T}\, dV,
```

{source}`rietx.model.absorption`

with $T$ the total (incident + diffracted) path length. For a cylinder it
depends only on $\mu R$ and $\theta$. Rouse et al. {cite}`rouse1970` fit that
integral over $0 \le \mu R \le$ {{ CYLINDER_MU_R_MAX }} to better than 0.0035
with

```{math}
:label: corr-rouse

A(\mu R, \theta) \;=\;
\exp\!\bigl\{ -(a_1 + b_1 \sin^2\theta)\,\mu R
              - (a_2 + b_2 \sin^2\theta)\,\mu R^2 \bigr\},
```

```{math}
:label: corr-rouse-coeff

a_1 = 1.7133, \quad b_1 = -0.0368, \quad a_2 = -0.0927, \quad b_2 = -0.3750.
```

{source}`rietx.model.absorption`

```{warning}
$A$ here is the transmission coefficient, ≤ 1, and the forward model multiplies
it into the intensity. Most tabulations print the absorption correction
$A^* = 1/A \ge 1$ instead, {cite}`itc-c` Table 6.3.3.2 among them. Getting this
backwards inverts the θ-dependence. An identity test cannot detect the mistake,
since $A(0) = A^*(0) = 1$, and the direction of the θ-dependence can: $A$
increases with $2\theta$, because the mean path through a cylinder shortens
toward backscatter. One more digit to watch: $b_2 = -0.3750$, against the
$-0.0375$ a scan of the paper prints. {ref}`ch-method` records how that was
settled.
```

The expression factors exactly into $A = K(\mu R)\cdot\exp(+c(\mu R)
\sin^2\theta)$, a constant times a Debye-Waller shape. Applying it to a model
with free scale and displacement parameters is therefore an exact
reparameterisation, and $R_{wp}$ cannot move. Its whole physical content is the
Biso shift

```{math}
:label: corr-deltab

\Delta B \;=\; \frac{c(\mu R)\, \lambda^2}{2},
```

{source}`rietx.model.absorption.equivalent_delta_biso`

0.13 Å² at $\mu R = 0.5$ and 0.49 Å² at $\mu R = 1.0$ for Cu Kα. Neglecting
capillary absorption biases Biso low by that much. It is also why $\mu R$ is a
plain float and never refinable: a free $\mu R$ is an exactly singular direction
in the normal equations, rather than a merely correlated one.

### Absorption across a time-of-flight bank

$\mu$ is a function of $\lambda$ for a neutron, because absorption follows the
$1/v$ law while scattering does not {cite}`sears1992`:

```{math}
:label: corr-mu-neutron-tof

\mu(\lambda)\ [\mathrm{cm}^{-1}] \;=\; \sum_i n_i
   \left[\sigma_{\mathrm{abs},i}\frac{\lambda}{1.798\,\text{Å}}
   + \sigma_{\mathrm{coh},i} + \sigma_{\mathrm{inc},i}\right] \Big/ V
```

{source}`rietx.model.tof_spectrum.neutron_attenuation_terms`

so $\mu$ is exactly affine in $\lambda$, and on a fixed-angle bank
$\lambda = 2d\sin\theta_{\text{bank}}$, one wavelength per reflection. The
cylinder transmission factor {eq}`corr-rouse` is then evaluated per reflection at
its own $\mu R$, which is where GSAS evaluates it too: the manual's absorption
parameter for a flight-time histogram is written $A_B = \mu R/\lambda$
precisely because it is $\mu R$ *per ångström* that is constant across a bank
{cite}`larson2004`.

Three consequences worth stating, because none of them has a
constant-wavelength counterpart:

* It is computed, never refined. The manual's own warning (that the
  correction is indistinguishable from thermal motion and should not be
  refined) applies with more force here, not less. A scalar
  `Geometry.mu_r` is refused on a bank for the same reason: it is a claim at
  one wavelength. Declare `capillary_radius_mm` and let the composition
  supply $\mu$.
* The correction does not disappear into the scale. On a
  constant-wavelength capillary {eq}`corr-rouse` factors exactly into a constant
  times $\exp(c\sin^2\theta)$, so omitting it moves $B_{\text{iso}}$ and
  leaves $R_{wp}$ untouched. Here $\theta$ is fixed and $\mu R$ varies, so the
  correction has a shape in $d$ that neither the scale nor $B_{\text{iso}}$
  reproduces: measured on a synthetic Co capillary, $\mu R$ 0.13 to 0.63,
  refining with it off cost $R_{wp}$ 0.0123 → 0.0452 and moved
  $B_{\text{iso}}$ from 0.498(2) to 0.058(11) Å² against a generating 0.5.
* The Rouse domain has two ends. $\mu R \le 1$ can hold at the short-$\lambda$
  end of a bank and fail at the long one; the result reports the pair.
## Flat-plate absorption

The three flat-specimen cases of {cite}`itc-c` Table 6.3.3.1 follow from the
same volume average {eq}`corr-itc`, each in closed form. Nothing is a fit, so
there are no coefficients to transcribe wrongly. The thick reflection specimen,
case (1a), gives $A = 1/2\mu$ with no θ-dependence, because the $\sin\theta$ of
the beam footprint cancels against the $\sin\theta$ of the penetration depth. It
is identical to the phase scale, and it is what every Bragg-Brentano fit
implicitly assumes. The two implemented cases, both normalised:

```{math}
:label: corr-fp2

\text{reflection, finite thickness } t:\quad
A = 1 - e^{-2\mu t / \sin\theta} \;\longrightarrow\; 1
\text{ as } \mu t \to \infty,
```

{source}`rietx.model.absorption.flat_plate_reflection_absorption`

```{math}
:label: corr-fp3a

\text{symmetric transmission}:\quad
A = \sec\theta\, e^{-\mu t(\sec\theta - 1)}.
```

{source}`rietx.model.absorption.flat_plate_transmission_absorption`

```{warning}
The two cases take opposite answers about what "off" means. For reflection the
identity is an infinitely thick specimen. $\mu t$ absent means thick, and
$\mu t = 0$ is a specimen of no thickness, which diffracts nothing and raises.
Every other correction here has 0 as its identity. For transmission, $\mu t = 0$
leaves $\sec\theta$, and that factor is physics: the beam footprint on the tilted
plate grows as $\sec\theta$.
```

The bias directions differ. Finite-thickness reflection depresses high-angle
intensity, so a Biso refined without it comes back too large, the opposite sign
to the capillary. Transmission flips sign with thickness. Neither expression is
exactly absorbed by {scale, Biso} as the cylinder's is: the unabsorbed fraction
of $\ln A$ is 0.2–1.3 % for transmission and a few per cent for
finite-thickness reflection, measured at the reflection positions. $\mu t$ is
computed from the specimen and never refined, as $\mu R$ is, for the different
reason that it is ill-conditioned rather than exactly singular. The unabsorbed
fraction is reported, so a caller can disagree.

## Surface roughness

A rough or loosely packed flat specimen has a packing-density deficit in its
top layer. At low θ the beam crosses that layer at grazing incidence over a long
path, and the intensity is depressed. Suortti's form {cite}`suortti1972`:

```{math}
:label: corr-suortti

R(\theta) \;=\;
\frac{a + (1 - a)\, e^{-b/\sin\theta}}{a + (1 - a)\, e^{-b}},
```

{source}`rietx.model.corrections.surface_roughness_suortti`

normalised so $R(90°) = 1$. Read the two parameters by their physics. $a$ is
the intensity fraction surviving at grazing incidence, so $1 - a$ bounds the
depression. $b$ is the depleted layer's dimensionless optical depth, and it sets
where in angle the transition falls rather than how deep it goes. For
$b \ge 0$ the result is bounded, $0 < R \le 1$, so the correction only ever
depresses.

The Pitschke et al. form {cite}`pitschke1993`:

```{math}
:label: corr-pitschke

R(\theta) \;=\; 1 - c\, u (1 - u), \qquad u = \tau / \sin\theta.
```

{source}`rietx.model.corrections.surface_roughness_pitschke`

The paper's angle-independent term is exactly degenerate with the phase scale,
so it is factored out. What remains is the identifiable strength $c$ and the
roughness parameter τ. This model has a validity range and does not police it.
$R$ is monotone in θ only while $\sin\theta \ge 2\tau$, and beyond
$\sin\theta = \tau$ (its Eq 18) it would amplify intensity. The
`ROUGHNESS_OUTSIDE_REGIME` diagnostic owns that fence, evaluated at the
reflection positions, while the function itself stays smooth and unclamped so
the Jacobian keeps no kink. Uncorrected roughness
biases ADPs severely: Biso refines to −1.9 … −2.5 Å² where the corrected value
is +0.3.

## Secondary extinction

Extinction removes intensity from the strongest reflections, because the
diffracted beam re-diffracts inside a coherent domain. Left uncorrected, the
refinement compensates with a spuriously large Biso and a small scale.
Sabine's polycrystalline model {cite}`sabine1985,sabine1988,sabine1988b`
blends the two-beam limits by the fraction of a random powder in each
geometry:

```{math}
:label: corr-sabine

E(hkl) \;=\; E_B \sin^2\theta + E_L \cos^2\theta,
\qquad E_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x}},
```

```{math}
:label: corr-sabine-x

x \;=\; \mathrm{ext} \cdot |F|^2 \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{V}\right)^2
\cdot X_{\mathrm{pol}},
\qquad X_{\mathrm{pol}} = 0.079411\cdot\frac{1 + \cos^2 2\theta}{2},
```

{source}`rietx.model.extinction.sabine_extinction`

with $E_L$ a six-term series in $x$ for $0 < x \le 1$ and a two-term asymptote
above, $E_L = 1$ at $x \le 0$, and $|F|^2$ entering without multiplicity or Lp.
$\mathrm{ext} = 0$ gives $E \equiv \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ exactly.

```{warning}
Documented by physics rather than by letter: the Bragg component weights
$\sin^2\theta$ and the Laue component $\cos^2\theta$. That is the opposite of
the naive reading, because backscattering ($2\theta \to 180°$) is the Bragg-case
limit and forward scattering the Laue-case limit. The two Laue branches
deliberately do not join continuously at $x = 1$. The ~2 % step there is
inherited verbatim from the cross-code reference and is out of reach for real
powder data, where $x \ll 1$, and smoothing it would break the cross-code
golden.
```

### Extinction across a time-of-flight bank

{eq}`corr-sabine` and {eq}`corr-sabine-x` are used unchanged on a
flight-time bank: this is the one λ-dependent correction that needed no new
physics at all. λ enters only through $(\lambda/V)^2$, so the same function
takes an array of per-reflection wavelengths where the constant-wavelength
model passes one scalar per emission line, and $2\theta$ is the bank's, fixed.

What changes is that the correction now has a *trend across the histogram*
where a scan sees one wavelength. $x \propto |F|^2\lambda^2$, so at fixed
$|F|^2$ the deficit $1 - E$ goes as $\lambda^2$ (measured as a log-log slope
of 1.99 over a whole reflection list), and worth stating because the $\lambda^4$
one might expect belongs to the *Lorentz* factor {eq}`corr-lorentz-tof`, which
multiplies beside it. On a fixed-angle bank long λ means long $d$, so
extinction takes intensity out of the same end absorption does and the opposite
end the Debye-Waller factor does.

Measured on a synthetic Si bank generated with $\mathrm{ext} = 100$ ($E$ from
0.60 to 1.00 across the window) and refined both ways: with the coefficient
free, $R_{wp} = 0.0021$, $\mathrm{ext} = 99.8(1)$ and $B_{\text{iso}} =
0.4989(7)$ against a generating 0.5; with it held at zero, $R_{wp} = 0.0929$
and $B_{\text{iso}} = -0.152(28)$, negative, which is the classic signature
this section opens with.

```{note}
$\mathrm{ext}$ is four orders larger on a neutron phase than the 0.004-2 a
constant-wavelength X-ray fit uses, and that is a **unit** statement: $x$
carries $|F|^2$, which is in fm² for a neutron and electrons² for an X-ray.
Compare an extinction coefficient only against another fit of the same
radiation.
```

## Preferred orientation (March-Dollase)

A non-random crystallite orientation distribution biases intensities. The
March distribution {cite}`march1932` as folded into Rietveld refinement by
Dollase {cite}`dollase1986` is a per-reflection multiplier averaged over
the symmetry orbit (multiplicity $M$):

```{math}
:label: corr-md

P_{hkl} \;=\; \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m \in \mathrm{orbit}}
\left[ r^2 \cos^2\alpha_m + \frac{\sin^2\alpha_m}{r} \right]^{-3/2},
```

{source}`rietx.model.preferred_orientation.march_dollase_factors`

where $\alpha_m$ is the angle between the preferred-orientation axis and
the scattering vector of equivalent $m$. Both are reciprocal-lattice
directions (integer $hkl$), so the angle uses the reciprocal metric:

```{math}
:label: corr-md-angle

\cos\alpha \;=\;
\frac{\mathbf{h}_m \cdot G^* \cdot \mathbf{a}}
     {\sqrt{(\mathbf{h}_m \cdot G^* \cdot \mathbf{h}_m)
            (\mathbf{a} \cdot G^* \cdot \mathbf{a})}}.
```

{source}`rietx.model.preferred_orientation.cos2_alpha`

At $r = 1$ every bracket is 1, so $P \equiv 1$ exactly. Off is the identity,
for every reflection and every cell. Friedel mates give identical brackets, so
orbit merging is unaffected.

```{warning}
Codes disagree on the sign convention of $r$, so the physics is the contract
and the letter is not. For a reflection parallel to the axis, $P = r^{-3}$, so
$r < 1$ enhances axial reflections. In Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry with
axis = plate normal, $r < 1$ means a platy habit and $r > 1$ an acicular one. In
transmission (capillary) geometry the sense reverses for the same axis choice.
The correction is geometry-agnostic. The interpretation of $r$ is not.
```

Spherical-harmonics texture {cite}`vondreele1997` is not implemented; it is
planned for v2.

## Quantitative phase analysis and microabsorption

Weight fractions follow the Hill-Howard scale-factor relation
{cite}`hill1987` (see also {cite}`bish1988`):

```{math}
:label: corr-qpa

W_p \;=\; \frac{S_p\, (Z M V)_p}{\sum_q S_q\, (Z M V)_q},
```

{source}`rietx.optimize.qpa.weight_fractions`

with $Z$ formula units per cell, $M$ the formula mass and $V$ the cell volume,
all derived from the refined model. Occupancies enter the mass, so the
load-bearing quantity is the cell mass $ZM = \sum \mathrm{occ}\cdot m\cdot A$,
and the $Z/M$ split is display-only. These are fractions of the modelled
crystalline content, so they still sum to 1 when an amorphous fraction is
present.

When phases differ in absorption, coarse particles of an absorbing phase shadow
their own interiors. That is the Brindley microabsorption effect
{cite}`brindley1945`. In the parallel-path approximation for a sphere of radius
$R$:

```{math}
:label: corr-brindley

\tau(x) \;=\; \frac{3\,[\,2 - e^{-u}(u^2 + 2u + 2)\,]}{u^3},
\qquad u = 2x, \quad x = (\mu_p - \bar\mu)\, R,
```

{source}`rietx.optimize.qpa.brindley_tau`

exact at $\tau(0) = 1$, and $\tau > 1$ for a phase less absorbing than the
matrix. Inside the validity domain this agrees to <1 % with Brindley's own
geometry-averaged table, as represented by the two independently published fits
used by FullProf and MAUD {cite}`taylor1991`, which themselves scatter by ~1 %.
The validity fence is $\mu R \le$ {{ BRINDLEY_MU_R_FENCE }}, derived from
Brindley's $\mu D \le 0.1$ with $D = 2R$ the particle diameter. Conflating the
two conventions is a real and recorded mistake. The corrected fractions are
reported alongside the uncorrected Hill-Howard numbers, and never silently
substituted.
