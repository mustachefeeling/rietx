"""Assemble the landing page and the pages beside it.

  python build.py            -> dist/<page>.html  everything inlined (one file a page; what the artifact shows)
  python build.py --site     -> site/             every page + img/ + data/demo.json + notebooks/, for a web server
  python build.py --ref HEAD                      the notebooks at a ref other than the newest release tag

`src/shell.html` is what every page shares: the stylesheet, the top bar, the theme control
and the footer.  Each page in PAGES is a `<main>` (and any script of its own) in `src/`,
dropped into the shell at `%%MAIN%%`; the table gives its title, its description and the
footer's line saying who wrote it.  `%%IMG:name%%` becomes a data URI (inline) or
`img/<name>.png` (site); `%%DEMO%%` is data/demo.json inline, or empty for the site build,
where the page fetches data/demo.json at load; `%%TRANSCRIPT%%` is data/transcript.json
when it exists, else empty and the page draws its placeholder.  `%%NOTEBOOKS%%` is the
Jupyter quickstart's rows, one per tutorial notebook at the release (see `release_tag`).
