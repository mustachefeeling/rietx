# WP-1316 — a NeXus/HDF5 multi-scan reader, behind an extra

Milestone: unscheduled · Status: ⬜
Depends on: —

## Goal

`read_pattern` opens a NeXus/HDF5 file (`.nxs`/`.h5`) — typically an in-situ
reel, one 2-D block of N patterns against a shared 1-D axis — as N scans
under the existing `scan=`/`ScanInfo` idiom, behind a `rietx[hdf5]` extra,
with the axis and σ policies reused verbatim from `io/CLAUDE.md`. No new σ
machinery, no new axis rule.

## Context

From issue #135.

**Dispatch is first and structural**: the HDF5 magic
`\x89HDF\r\n\x1a\n` at offset 0. Today `.nxs` is refused by `looks_binary`
at the `xy` catch-all — unreadable by this build; h5py is not a dependency.

**Authority tiers, cheapest first.** NeXus application definitions
(NXsxrd/NXmonopd) and `NXdata` with `@signal`/`@axes` where declared are the
structural, trusted tier — a schema-named `@axes` cannot disagree with
itself. Attribute-less HDF5 falls back to axis-discovery heuristics **plus
`PATTERN_X_AXIS_ASSUMED`**, because that is inference. The three-way axis
rule applies unchanged: recognisably 2θ reads silently; recognisably
something else (a Q axis, an ω rocking curve, a φ pole-figure ring) raises
naming what the file holds; unrecognisable reads as 2θ and says so.

**A private prototype establishes the rules and is ported, not copied**
(`probe_nexus`, maintainer-local): walk with `h5py.visititems` for a 1-D
numeric dataset whose length matches a block dimension, strictly monotonic,
with a plausible 2θ span (0 ≤ x0 < 180, x1 ≤ 180, span > 5°) or Q span
(0 ≤ x0 < 30, x1 ≤ 30, span > 1 Å⁻¹); the matching axis length picks the
block orientation. These discriminators are also what reject the ML trap — a
naive "2-D and big enough" test would swallow 1290 256×256 weight matrices.
A Poisson self-check (adjacent-channel difference std ≈ √(2·mean); measured
0.39 against ~13 on a simulated file) flags synthetic data — **at most a
diagnostic, never a refusal**.

**σ tiers, reused verbatim**: explicit `errors`/`NXdata@uncertainties` when
present (structural, trusted); Poisson √max(y,1) for a counts block;
**withheld with `PATTERN_INTENSITY_SCALED`** where the block is a rate or
the scale cannot be verified. Plus `ScanInfo` per row, `scan=` selection,
`PATTERN_MULTISCAN_DEFAULTED` on scan 0, refusals naming the `.nxs` rather
than an h5py exception, and the WP-1110 item-17 rule: a series coordinate is
surfaced on `ScanInfo` only where the format names it, never invented off an
unnamed axis.

**The extra can only add** (the numba precedent in `io/CLAUDE.md`): there is
no `rietx[slow]` that installs fewer formats, so `rietx[hdf5]` pulls h5py
and enables this one format, the base install stays lean, and
`capabilities()` reports the format only when h5py imports. Unlike numba —
required, because the numpy fallback runs the same expressions — there is no
pure-python HDF5 fallback, so h5py gates the format rather than
accelerating a path.

**Fixtures are synthesized, never vendored** (~1290 archive `.nxs`/`.h5`
exist and none may ship): h5py packs the NeXus structure literally — an
`NXdata` group with `@signal`/`@axes`, a small 2-D block, a 1-D 2θ axis,
sharing no constants with the reader — or files come from the NeXus
standard's own examples with licence checked per file. Real-file facts
(block shapes `(3134, 2051)`, `(27, 3590)`; the discriminators; the
counts-vs-synthetic check) go in `tests/data/README.md` without the files.

## Non-goals

- **Not detector-image HDF** — an `NXdetector` frame stack is not a profile
  (the `.brml` `RecordedRawDataView` precedent).
- **Not general HDF5 ingestion** — the span discriminators are the fence.
- **Not Q → 2θ conversion** — needs a wavelength the reader must not assume;
  a recognisable Q axis raises, naming it.
- **Not NXcanSAS, not writing.**
- **Stays local to the maintainer's catalogue**: series assembly, the
  synthetic-suspect campaign flag, ramp subsampling.

## Tasks

- [ ] The extra: `[hdf5]` in `pyproject.toml`, soft import, `capabilities()`
      formats arm gated on the import; the format token spelled in
      `_about.py`.
- [ ] The reader: magic dispatch, tiered axis authority, block orientation,
      `scan=`/`ScanInfo`/`PATTERN_MULTISCAN_DEFAULTED`, refusals naming the
      file.
- [ ] σ tiers + the Poisson self-check as a diagnostic.
- [ ] Synthetic fixtures + `test_readers_robust.py` arm + the README facts
      row; skill row and manual line.

## Acceptance

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_reader_hdf5.py tests/test_readers_robust.py tests/test_capabilities.py   # first module is new, this WP's
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -n auto --dist loadgroup -m "not slow"
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests examples
```

The bar: with h5py absent the build imports, refuses the format by name and
reports it unavailable; with it, the declared-`@axes` fixture reads
silently, the bare-HDF5 fixture reads with `PATTERN_X_AXIS_ASSUMED`, a Q-axis fixture raises naming Q, and a 256×256 matrix is
refused.

The shipping PR carries `Closes #135`.

## Handover log

- **2026-09-01** — created, from issue #135 (2026-09-01 triage). Settled:
  tiers, discriminators, the extra's shape; first open item is the extra's
  name (`hdf5` vs `nexus`) and the format token.
