# WP-1949 — an accepted evaluation carries what a preview draws

Milestone: unscheduled · Status: ⬜
Track: Render what the fit already knows
Depends on: —
Priority: P3 2026-10-11 — a live preview keeps a shadow refinement and re-predicts every frame (about 0.7 s a frame on a large framework); the workaround works and costs a throttle

## Goal

A caller watching a fit through `events=` can draw the current curve, atoms
and cell from an accepted `eval` event, without a second refinement. It is
opt-in, the default event stays as small as it is, and the recorder's
`events.jsonl` never carries the curve.

## Context

**The report (issue #892).** An application previews a running fit live.
An accepted `eval` event carries only the free values (`data.values`, in
the `free_paths` order `stage_start` gives). To draw the pattern the app
keeps a "shadow" refinement of the same phase. Each frame it resets the
atoms to their starting positions (a `dof` value is a step from where the
atom was), calls `set_values`, then `predict`. That is about 5 ms a frame on
rutile and about 0.7 s on MFU-4l (the reporter's numbers), so they throttle
frames. They ask for an off-by-default option to put `y_calc`, the current
atom positions and the cell on accepted `eval` events.

**Checked at `d80ca5f4`.**
- The TRF wrapper emits `eval` with `stage`, `n_eval`, `cost`, `accepted`,
  `step_norm` and `values` (`optimize/least_squares.py:1677-1690`). The LM
  driver's `trial_cb` (`:1346-1353`) emits the same plus `lam`, and is handed
  θ and the cost, not the residual.
- `values` is `_free_values` (`:1308-1319`): `table.decode(θ)` filtered to
  `free_paths`. The decode already holds every moving path, including the
  tied `x`/`y`/`z` and the cell (92 keys on FAP). The filter discards them.
  A coordinate is absolute in the decode (root CLAUDE.md, WP-1432), so
  carrying the moving paths removes the reporter's reset step.
- **The curve is already computed.** The residual is
  `sqrt_w·(y_obs − model.evaluate(...))` (`model/rows.py:136`), so inside the
  TRF wrapper `y_calc = y_obs − r[:n_data]/sqrt_w` on the fitted channels.
  `predict()` differs from it on 36 of 4200 channels at up to 8e-6 because
  it freezes the windows differently (its docstring).
- **What it costs if serialised.** FAP.XRA (5753 points, `mccusker_structural`):
  86 `eval` events, 70 accepted, 10.6 ms an evaluation. An accepted line is
  256 B. `json.dumps` of `y_calc` takes 1.65 ms and 111 kB an event (50 kB at
  3 decimals). On every accepted event that is about 7.8 MB a fit and 16 %
  on evaluation time. Handing a callback an ndarray costs a slice and a
  divide.
- `EventStream.emit` (`history/events.py:152`) runs the callback on the fit
  thread and `json.dumps` the event for its file sink (`:156`). An ndarray
  cannot pass that. A new key in `data` needs no `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
  bump (`events.py` docstring).

**Rules this meets.** A live view is numbers a viewer draws, never a page
the fit builds (root CLAUDE.md, WP-1402). `viz/snapshot.py` already writes
the curve once a stage, decimated to `MAX_POINTS = 4000`. WP-1402 and
WP-1403 measured megabytes a stage when a page rode the fit, so the
recorder's `events.jsonl` must not receive a per-evaluation curve. A
per-stage charge is judged on the shortest fit (WP-1413). The recorder is
attached beside a caller's stream, never inside it (WP-1403), so a payload
can reach the caller's callback and skip the recorder.

## Non-goals

- The per-stage `snapshot.json` and `rietx watch` (unchanged).
- A post-hoc aggregate of an events log (WP-1322).
- Throttling events by count (WP-1413's rule: by time, if ever).

## Tasks

- [ ] Measure first, on a model whose evaluation is dear (the reporter's
      MFU-4l class, or the largest structure in `tests/data`): evaluations
      per fit, accepted share, and the per-event cost of (a) the moving-path
      values, (b) an ndarray `y_calc` handed to a callback, (c) a decimated
      JSON `y_calc`. Record the numbers here.
- [ ] Decide the spelling and record it as `Decided YYYY-MM-DD:`. The
      options are a `fit(..., eval_payload=...)` flag, or a property of the
      callback the caller passes. Decide too whether `y_calc` reaches only
      an in-process callback (ndarray, never the file sink) or also the file
      at `MAX_POINTS`.
- [ ] Carry the moving-path values (coordinates and cell, absolute) on
      accepted `eval` events under the opt-in, on both drivers. The LM path
      needs the residual plumbed to `trial_cb`.
- [ ] Carry `y_calc` under the decided form. Test: on accepted events it
      equals `y_obs − r/sqrt_w` and lands within the documented 8e-6 of
      `predict()` at the event's values. The recorder's `events.jsonl` is
      byte-identical with the option on and off.
- [ ] Tests + obs/calc/diff PNGs to `tests/output/`.
- [ ] Manual (`using/refining.md` § events) and the event table in the
      skill's API index.
- [ ] Skill: one row in the reference that documents `events=`. Nothing in
      the body.

## Acceptance

With the option on, a callback draws the curve and the atoms from accepted
`eval` events alone and matches `predict()` at those values within 8e-6.
With it off, every event and the recorder's log are byte-identical to
today's.

## Handover log

- **2026-10-11** — created, from the 2026-10-11 issue triage (issue #892).
  Checked against the tree at `d80ca5f4`: an `eval` event carries only the
  free values on both drivers, the decode it filters already holds the
  coordinates and cell, and `y_calc` is recoverable from the residual the
  TRF wrapper holds. No open WP owns it: WP-1402, 1404, 1413 and 1438 (the
  live view and its cost) are closed, and WP-1322 aggregates a log after the
  fact. *Next:* task 1.
