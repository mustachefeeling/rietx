# WP-1455 — a TOPAS TCHZ profile reads in

Milestone: unscheduled · Status: ⬜
Depends on: — (1433 soft: the `.inp` grammar the reader still refuses)
Priority: P3 2026-09-24 — a hand translation works; it cost an agent six source reads, and nothing checks the letters

## Goal

An instrument profile stated in TOPAS's `TCHZ_Peak_Type` form becomes an
`Instrument` without a hand translation, `Z` term included. So does the
goniometer radius, if the file's `Rs` is that radius. Each profile
parameter's help entry names its TOPAS equivalent.

## Context

**The evidence.** A 2026-09-24 transcript review read an agent session on a
private synchrotron in-situ series: `in-situ series 1` in the private
`yue-here/rietx-corpus-map`. Quote only what the runs did (CONTRIBUTING,
WP-1450). The instrument file came in TOPAS form: `prm` lines for U, V, W, Z,
X and Y, a zero shift, an axial term, and two radii (`Rp`, `Rs`). rietx has
no reader for it.

The agent spent six tool calls grepping the source for the width convention
and for what happens to a negative variance. `help_for` gave
Γ_G² = U·tan²θ + V·tanθ + W, but not how a Z term folds in. The file's own
W + Z is negative, so Γ_G² < 0 at low angle. `RESOLUTION_NOT_POSITIVE` fired
on the first fit, where U, V and W were free, and that finding was correct.
The agent then replaced them with (0, 0, 10⁻⁶) for the rest of the session,
reasoning that TOPAS clamps the negative variance to about zero. Nobody has
checked that.

`CAPILLARY_OFFSET_UNAVAILABLE` asked for a goniometer radius on 48 of 48
patterns of each final chain, and the agent never set one. TOPAS's `Rs` is
the secondary radius, which is probably the number that finding wants. Verify
the meaning before reading it in.

**The translation.** Take TOPAS's TCHZ Gaussian FWHM² as
U·tan²θ + V·tanθ + W + Z/cos²θ. Then Z/cos²θ = Z + Z·tan²θ, so Z folds
exactly into U + Z and W + Z, and rietx needs no new parameter. rietx's own
1/cos²θ Gaussian term is the per-phase sample size `P` (`gauss_size`,
`docs/manual/profiles.md` eq `prof-caglioti-g`), which is λ-scaled across
histograms (WP-1131). It is the wrong home for an instrument term.

For the Lorentzian, rietx's X is the 1/cosθ term and Y the tanθ term
(`help_for("instrument.profile.x")`). TOPAS appears to name them the other
way round, and the agent's translation swapped the letters to keep the
physics. **Every letter and unit here is to be measured against TOPAS's own
output, never adopted from its prose** (root CLAUDE.md, comparing against
another code).

**The seams.** `src/rietx/io/instrument_profile.py` holds the instrument-file
readers: GSAS-I `.prm` (`read_gsas_prm`) and GSAS-II `.instprm`. The TOPAS
`.inp` reader (`src/rietx/io/projects/topas.py`, `read_topas_inp`) builds a
`Structure` only. Its docstring says `to_structure` never builds an
`Instrument`, and the emission profile and geometry stay on `TopasModel`.
How to add a format, and what a reader may repair:
`src/rietx/io/CLAUDE.md`.

**Scope question.** A TOPAS profile arrives two ways. One is a
`TCHZ_Peak_Type(…)` macro call in an `.inp`. The other is a bare fragment of
named `prm` lines, which is what this session had. The fragment has no fixed
grammar, since the names are the user's. So the first cut is probably the
macro, with the fragment left to the caller and the help entries.

### Inherited

**From the 2026-09-25 review of a second session on the same series.** A
second agent session read the same instrument file and made the same
translation. It folded Z into U and W, set the file's 1/cosθ Lorentzian term
as rietx X and dropped the tanθ one as about zero. It replaced the Gaussian
terms with (0, 0, 10⁻⁶), because the folded variance is non-positive below
2θ ≈ 62°, which covers the whole fitted range. It got there with one
`help_for` call over the profile paths, against the first session's six source
reads. It also took `Rs` as the goniometer radius. `CAPILLARY_OFFSET_UNAVAILABLE`
then fired on 0 of 48 final results, against 48 of 48 in the first session.
That is consistent with the guess about `Rs` above, and it does not verify it.
Two sessions have now zeroed the Gaussian by hand, so what TOPAS does with a
negative variance is still the open question.

## Non-goals

- Fundamental parameters beyond one radius (`Rp`, TOPAS's full axial model).
  FPA is fenced to v2.
- Writing TOPAS profiles out.

## Tasks

- [ ] Measure the letters and units against TOPAS's own output. Archive
      file 8 in the private corpus map is a TCHZ `.inp`; cite it by number
      (WP-1450). Where the archive holds no TOPAS output, say so and measure
      against the published TCHZ definition instead.
- [ ] Verify what `Rs` means against the TOPAS Technical Reference, and read
      it into `goniometer_radius_mm` if it is that radius.
- [ ] Help entries: each `instrument.profile.*` entry names its TOPAS and
      GSAS-II equivalent, and U and W say how a Z term folds into them.
      `tests/test_help.py` crosses the vocabulary both ways.
- [ ] Read `TCHZ_Peak_Type(…)` from an `.inp` into an `Instrument`, beside
      the GSAS readers or through `read_topas_inp`. Decide which, and write it
      here.
- [ ] Tests: a synthetic `.inp` with a nonzero Z round-trips to the same
      Γ_G(θ) to 1e-12 across 5-150°. The Z fold is algebra, so this tolerance
      is exactness, not a measured spread.
- [ ] Skill: one line in `references/api.md`'s reader list, generated.

## Acceptance

A TCHZ `.inp` reads to an `Instrument` whose Γ_G and Γ_L match the bar task
1 established: TOPAS's own output where the archive holds one, the published
definition otherwise. The WP says which bar was used.

## Handover log

- **2026-09-24** — created from the review of an agent session on a private
  series. The readers and the absent TCHZ handling were checked against the
  tree at `2d42303a`. The Z fold is algebra; the TOPAS letters and `Rs` are
  unverified. Next: measure the letters.
