# WP-1942 — a soft restraint on a sum of parameters across phases

Milestone: unscheduled · Status: ⬜
Track: Coming from another code
Depends on: —
Priority: P3 2026-10-11 — a named user has waited since 2026-09-01; a variable, a tie and a value restraint cover it today, clumsily

## Goal

A refinement can carry a soft restraint on a linear sum of parameters,
√w·(Σ c_k·p_k − target)/σ, where the paths may belong to different phases.
A helper builds the coefficients for a conserved elemental ratio from the
phases' element counts and cell volumes, so issue #212's
Cu/(Ca+Al) = 1.935 is one call.

## Context

**The use case (issue #212).** A supported-catalyst reduction series loses
only oxygen, so the elemental ratio Cu/(Ca+Al) keeps its as-prepared value of
1.935 throughout. Diffraction alone cannot split the unaccounted mass
between two phases: moving one of them 17 wt % costs 0.2–0.5 pp of Rwp. The
stoichiometry separates them decisively, since the two candidate partitions
imply 2.115 and 1.266.

**Why it is linear.** Moles of element E are proportional to
Σ_p S_p·V_p·n_{E,p}, and the (ZM)_p cancels. So the ratio r = Cu/(Ca+Al) is
the row Σ_p a_p·S_p = 0, with a_p = V_p·(n_{Cu,p} − r·(n_{Ca,p} + n_{Al,p})).
The partials are constant, and no expression language is needed.

**The seams, checked at `f11e22d3`.**
- `Structure` (`schemas/structure.py`) has one field, `phases`.
- `Phase.restraints` holds `BondRestraint`, `AngleRestraint` and
  `ValueRestraint`. A `ValueRestraint.path` is already any dot-path in the
  model tree, so a single-path row may name another phase today. A
  multi-path row has no type.
- `model/restraints.py`: `resolve_phase_restraints` compiles a phase's list
  to items, and `_Value.phase` is already `int | None`. A structure-level
  item can therefore carry `phase=None`. `restraint_residual`,
  `restraint_partials` and `summarise_restraints` read the items.
- `model/rows.py`: `BLOCK_ORDER` ends in `soft_restraint`. WP-1119's seam note
  said a new block. A new item kind inside `soft_restraint` may be enough,
  and it inherits the statistics exclusion (restraint rows stay in the
  covariance and out of Rwp, Durbin-Watson and Bérar-Lelann) and the stage's
  c_w (`Stage.restraint_weight_scale`). Task 1 decides.
- `model/geometry.py` calls `restraint_partials` at σ = weight = 1 for every
  reported geometry esd. A new item kind must be handled there, or excluded
  there by name.
- `optimize/qpa.py`: `phase_zmv(...)` computes `element_counts`, the
  occupancy-weighted atom count per element per cell.
  `PhaseQuantity` (`schemas/results.py`) does not carry it.
- `refine.py`: `RESTRAINT_TENSION_SIGMA = 3.0` and
  `_restraint_tension_diagnostics` flag a row the data pulls more than 3σ
  from its target, per pattern. `sequential.py`'s
  `SEQUENTIAL_PERSISTENT_FINDING` aggregates any code fired in over half a
  series' patterns, counted per (code, path). A multi-path row needs one
  stable `where` key, or the series count splits across its paths.

**What runs today, measured at `f11e22d3`.** Two synthetic cubic phases
(rock salt and Si, Cu Kα1, 20–110°, step 0.02°, true scale ratio 1/0.6). The
spelling: `add_variable("excess", ..., vary=True)`, then
`tie("phases.0.scale", {"vars.excess": 1/a0, "phases.1.scale": -a1/a0})`,
then a `ValueRestraint(path="vars.excess", target=0, sigma=...)`.
- With `"vars.*"` added to the first stage of `mccusker_default`, the fit
  converges. The scale ratio is 1.675 against 1.667 true, and `vars.excess`
  has an esd.
- With the preset unchanged, the plan replaces the vary flags (WP-1208), so
  the variable stays at its start value. Phase 1's scale went to its floor,
  and `MODEL_FAR_FROM_DATA` and `RESTRAINT_TENSION` fired.
- Three costs stay with the workaround. One scale becomes a dependent of
  two sources, so its bound reaches the solver only as an enclosing box,
  and a corner outside it raises on write-back after the solve (skill
  `references/surprises.md` § 8.22). The σ is in scale units, where the
  user means a σ on the ratio. And the caller must know to free `vars.*`.

The probe script is `scratchpad/t212/probe.py` in the 2026-10-11 triage
session. It is 50 lines and is restated by the first test this WP writes.

**The issue's fences, adopted.**
- **Soft, with an honest σ, and self-reporting.** Real phase weights do
  change. A mixed intermediate can form and disappear, and a hard constraint
  would hide it.
- **Coefficients from occupancies are frozen at declaration.** Chaining
  derivatives through refined occupancies is out of scope. A stage that
  frees an occupancy of a phase in the row makes the coefficient stale, and
  that must be reported, never silent.
- **No series-level pool or tie.** It cannot express a ratio, and it blurs
  the line between `sequential` (chained fits) and `multi` (one joint
  residual).

**Prior art, concepts only.** TOPAS states a constraint as a `prm` and an
equation over named parameters. GSAS-II carries linear constraints and
equivalences as (coefficient, parameter) lists. The (path, coefficient) pair
form here follows WP-1119's decision 4, which kept strings out of storage.

### Inherited

- **2026-10-11, from the issue triage: issue #349's three exports come with
  this WP.** WP-1325's mailbox recorded on 2026-09-21 that whichever WP cuts
  the #212 row exports them, since `rietx.navigate` (#349, fenced at v2+)
  reads the same quantity. The three:
  `PhaseQuantity.element_counts: dict[str, float]` (a `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  bump); a weight-fraction covariance beside the existing
  `weight_fraction_stderr` diagonal; and `FitReport.unidentified_phase`
  (`present`, `n_foreign`, `n_shift_matched`, `strongest_two_theta`), which a
  program today recovers by parsing `layer0_actions` for
  `add_impurity_phase`. Checked at `f11e22d3`: none of the three exists. The
  third shares no code with the row and may split off if it grows.
  **Decided 2026-09-21** (posted on #349, moved here from 1325): when
  `navigate` is cut it lives inside the package on `indexing`'s pattern, and
  the nominal composition is an argument to `sample_from_result`, never a
  field on a result, which records measurements only. The same rule binds
  the ratio helper here: the declared ratio is an input, and no result
  field stores it as if measured.
- **2026-10-13, from the issue triage (#212): the reporter's answers to task
  1's two questions.** Posted 2026-10-12. (1) The row lives on
  `Structure.restraints`: a row over several phases has no single owner, and
  in one phase's list it dangles when phases are removed or reordered or the
  phase is copied into a structure where its paths do not resolve; the
  per-phase union stays for rows inside one phase. (2) It is an item inside
  the `soft_restraint` block, not a new `BLOCK_ORDER` entry:
  r = (Σ aᵢ·pᵢ − t)/σ is `ValueRestraint`'s form generalised to (path,
  coefficient) pairs, with the same χ² term and `RESTRAINT_TENSION`
  reporting. Checked against the tree at c3d0367: `_Value`
  (`model/restraints.py:100`) holds one `path` and the block makes one row
  per item (`CompiledRestraints.n_rows`), so the item shape fits without a
  new block. Task 1 still records the maintainer's decision.

## Non-goals

- Nonlinear expressions over parameters. That is `Parameter.expr`'s
  designed-but-unbuilt DSL (WP-1119 § Non-goals).
- A hard linear constraint. `Refinement.tie` with several sources is one
  already (WP-1119).
- A parametric function of the series axis. That is WP-1325.
- A trigger on a consecutive run of tension across a series. The majority
  rollup exists. Measure a case it misses before building another.

## Tasks

- [ ] Decide where the row lives: `Structure.restraints` (the issue's
      proposal and 1119's seam note) or a `LinearRestraint` kind in the
      existing per-phase union. Decide whether it is a new `BLOCK_ORDER`
      block or an item kind in `soft_restraint`. Record both in this file.
- [ ] The schema type, (path, coefficient) pairs plus target, σ and weight,
      with its JSON round-trip and the `SCHEMA_VERSION` or project-format
      bump it needs.
- [ ] Compile, residual and analytic partials; the geometry-esd path
      handles or excludes it; `summarise_restraints` and
      `RESTRAINT_TENSION` report it under one stable `where`.
- [ ] The elemental-ratio helper: coefficients from `element_counts` and
      cell volumes, σ stated on the ratio, and a report when a stage frees
      an occupancy of a phase in the row.
- [ ] The three #349 exports from § Inherited.
- [ ] Tests: the probe above as a regression, a synthetic two-phase series
      where the ratio decides the partition, cross-backend agreement for the
      new partials (`tests/test_cross_backend.py`); obs/calc/diff PNGs to
      `tests/output/`.
- [ ] Manual: Part 1 `using/constraints.md` (restraint vs constraint, the
      worked ratio); Part 2 the row's equation with its *Source* line.
- [ ] Skill: a reference row for the new restraint kind and the ratio
      helper, keyed by their names.

## Acceptance

The issue's worked case, reduced to a synthetic two-phase pattern where
diffraction alone leaves the partition flat: the restrained fit recovers the
true weight fractions within their esds, and `RESTRAINT_TENSION` fires when
the declared ratio is wrong by 5σ.

## Handover log

- **2026-10-11** — created, from the 2026-10-11 issue triage (issue #212).
  Checked against the tree at `f11e22d3`: every seam the issue names exists
  as described, `Structure` holds no cross-phase list, and a variable plus a
  multi-source tie plus a `ValueRestraint` already expresses the row when
  the plan frees `vars.*`. No open WP owns it: WP-1119 (✅) decided on
  2026-09-04 that the row is a WP of its own, and WP-1325's mailbox and
  ROADMAP both recorded that nobody had cut it. WP-1340 touches
  `PhaseQuantity` for mole fractions and takes none of the three exports.
  *Next:* task 1.
