# WP-1537 — the structure scene for a ray tracer: POV-Ray and glTF

Milestone: v1.7 · Status: ⬜
Depends on: 1536 soft (the GUI menu lists SVG once it lands)
Priority: P3 2026-10-02 — a workaround covers it: a CIF opened in Blender's atomic add-on or in VESTA, which loses rietx's bond rules, polyhedra and colours

## Goal

`render_structure(..., path="figure.pov")` writes a POV-Ray 3.7 scene, and
`path="figure.glb"` writes a glTF 2.0 binary. Both carry the figure's camera
and light. `povray figure.pov` ray-traces the same framing, and Blender
imports the `.glb` with materials, camera and light ready for Cycles. The
GUI's export button offers SVG, POV-Ray and glTF beside PNG.

## Context

### Why now

The maintainer asked on 2026-10-02 whether the figure could go to Blender
for ray tracing, then asked for ray-tracer input with WP-1536 (SVG) and
WP-1538 (ambient occlusion). WP-1470's Non-goals fenced shadows and ambient
occlusion out of the CPU renderer, and a ray tracer supplies both. No open
WP owns an export format.

### Prior art

- VESTA exports POV-Ray, VRML, X3D and STL among others (References).
- ChimeraX saves `.glb`, `.stl`, `.obj` and `.x3d`. A 2020 post on its
  users' mailing list recommends glTF for getting a scene into Blender,
  Cinema4D or Maya. It exports shapes and vertex colours only and leaves
  materials, camera and lighting to the target program. This WP writes a
  camera, a light and materials, because a figure's framing is most of the
  work.
- The same post notes that STL carries no colour and OBJ no vertex colour.
  That is why neither is written here (Non-goals).
- **Never open ChimeraX's source code, and copy nothing from it** (the
  maintainer, 2026-10-02). Its user documentation and mailing list are the
  only ChimeraX sources here.
- POV-Ray is AGPL-3.0 and ASE's POV-Ray writer is LGPL. This WP writes
  POV-Ray's input language and ports no code. Read ASE's writer for its
  camera and finish conventions, concepts only.

### What the writers read

The same scene WP-1536 reads (`scene.build_scene`): `atoms` with `pos`,
`shape` (3×3 row-major M, surface `pos + M·u` with |u| = 1), `color` and
`rings`; `halves` with `from`, `to`, `radius` and `color`; `lines` with a
width in CSS px; `faces` drawn at `POLY_ALPHA` = 0.55; `labels`. `render.py`
supplies the view rotation, the fitted `raster.Frame` (its `ppa` converts a
pixel width to Å), the letters as Hershey strokes (`glyphs.py`) and the
background. `scene.LOOK` holds the light and finish: light direction
`[-0.40, 0.55, 0.73]` in view space, ambient 0.45, diffuse 0.60, specular
0.16, shininess 40. A principal ring is where the smallest unit-frame
coordinate is under `ring_width` = 0.035.

### POV-Ray

- An atom is `sphere { 0, 1 ... matrix <M> translate pos }`, an exact
  ellipsoid, as the raster solves it. POV-Ray's `matrix` lists the images of
  x, y and z in turn, so its first three numbers are M's first **column**.
  Written in `shape`'s row-major order, the sphere takes Mᵀ, and MᵀM is a
  different ellipsoid whenever M is not symmetric. glTF's `node.matrix` is
  column-major for the same reason.
- A ring is a pigment in the unit frame, before the matrix:
  `function { min(abs(x), min(abs(y), abs(z))) }` under a colour map with
  one step at `ring_width`. That is the shader's own rule, exact on the
  ellipsoid.
- A bond half is `cylinder { from, to, r open }`, open as the raster's are.
  A face is a `mesh2` with `transmit` 1 − `POLY_ALPHA`. A line is a cylinder
  of radius ½·width·`px_scale` / `ppa`, since `width` is in CSS px and `ppa`
  is per image pixel (`raster._pack` scales it the same way). The letters
  are the Hershey strokes as thin cylinders in the camera plane, so no font
  file is needed.
- The camera is `orthographic` with the frame's width and height in Å.
  **POV-Ray is left-handed** and rietx's Cartesian frame is right-handed.
  Without a mirror the picture is the enantiomer, and a centrosymmetric
  test phase cannot show it. Test with a chiral phase and compare against
  the PNG. NAC (I2₁3, `tests/data/cod_1000236.cif`) and quartz (P3₂21,
  entry 12 of `tests/data/polyhedra_phases.json`) are both to hand.
- One `light_source` at the camera's `LOOK` direction, with `finish`
  values mapped from `LOOK`. Radiosity, POV-Ray's global illumination, is
  written behind `#declare RIETX_RADIOSITY = off;`, so a user turns it on
  with one edit.

### glTF 2.0

- A `.glb` is a JSON chunk and a binary chunk. The standard library and
  numpy write it, with no dependency. `.gltf` with a separate `.bin` is two
  files and is declined.
- One unit icosphere and one open unit cylinder hold the geometry. Each
  colour gets a mesh over those shared accessors, since glTF binds a
  material to a mesh primitive. Each atom and each half is a node.
- glTF node matrices must decompose into translation, rotation and scale,
  with no shear. Ball mode's M is r·I. Ellipsoid mode's M should be the
  principal axes (`structure3d._pin_axes`) times the semi-axes, which
  decomposes. Verify it. Where det < 0, negate one axis, because the
  ellipsoid is symmetric under it. Where M does not decompose, bake the
  vertices.
- A ringed atom uses a sphere split into band and non-band triangles: two
  primitives, two materials.
- Faces are one mesh per polyhedron with `alphaMode: BLEND` and base colour
  alpha `POLY_ALPHA`. Lines and letters are thin cylinders, as in POV-Ray.
- An orthographic camera node with `xmag`/`ymag` from the frame. They are
  half the frame's width and height in Å, and Blender's importer doubles
  them into its ortho scale. Then one
  `KHR_lights_punctual` directional light at the `LOOK` direction. Blender
  imports both.
- glTF is right-handed with +Y up, in metres. Write 1 Å as one unit and say
  so in the manual. Blender's importer converts +Y up to +Z up.
- Check every file with the Khronos glTF-Validator (`npx gltf-validator`,
  Apache-2.0, 2.0.0-dev.3.10 on npm on 2026-10-02).

### Tools for the one-off check

`brew install povray` gives 3.7.0.10. `brew install --cask blender` gives
5.2.2. Neither is a test dependency. A task below renders once with each and
commits the pictures beside the PNG.

### The GUI

The PNG export stays client-side (`Structure3D.svelte`, `gl3d.ts`'s
`exportPng`). The other formats come from one server route, for example
`POST /api/structure3d/export`. Its body is the format, the panel's `View`
(`rotation`, `zoom`, `pan`; `structure3d.ts:785`), the canvas's CSS size and
the query options `GET /api/structure3d` already takes. It calls the same
writers through `render.gui_frame`. That frame is the canvas's at zoom 1
with no pan, so the route applies the `View`'s `zoom` and `pan` to it before
the file can have the canvas's framing.
`gui/CLAUDE.md` holds the server contract. `tests/test_gui_manual.py`
partitions the routes, so the route needs a manual chapter in the same
change.

### Seams

- `src/rietx/viz/figure3d/render.py`: the suffix dispatch WP-1536 adds
  `.svg` to. Whichever lands second extends it.
- A new `src/rietx/viz/figure3d/scene3d.py` (or one module per format):
  the scene, view and frame to a POV-Ray text and a GLB byte string.
- `src/rietx/gui/server.py` and `gui/src/panels/Structure3D.svelte` for the
  menu, then a rebuilt dist.

## Non-goals

- STL, OBJ, X3D and VRML. STL has no colour and OBJ no vertex colour.
  Blender converts a glTF into each of them.
- A 3D-printable model. It needs thicker sticks than a figure and one
  closed solid, which is its own WP if someone asks.
- Ambient occlusion in rietx's own renderers: WP-1538. In these formats the
  ray tracer supplies it.
- A Blender add-on or a `bpy` script. glTF import ships with Blender.

## Tasks

- [ ] The `.pov` writer: atoms, rings, halves, faces, lines, letters,
  camera and light. Test: the handedness check on a chiral phase, an
  unrendered text comparison against a committed small case, and each
  atom's `matrix`, read in POV-Ray's column order, mapping the unit sphere
  onto `pos + M·u` on an ellipsoid whose M is not symmetric.
- [ ] The `.glb` writer. Test: the file parses as GLB (magic, version,
  chunk lengths), node transforms reproduce each atom's `shape` to 1e-12,
  and the validator reports no errors on the corpus.
- [ ] Render the fluorapatite and NAC figures once with POV-Ray and once in
  Blender (Cycles, the imported camera). Commit each beside the PNG under
  `docs/wp/1537-renders/` and record the commands in the handover.
- [ ] The GUI: the route, the export menu (PNG, SVG once 1536 lands,
  POV-Ray, glTF), the manual chapter and a browser test that downloads a
  `.glb` and checks its header. Rebuild the dist.
- [ ] Docs: `docs/manual/using/exports.md` gains a section on ray-tracer
  input, with the POV-Ray command and the Blender import steps. The
  `render_structure` docstring names each suffix.
- [ ] Tests + the render pictures to `tests/output/figure3d/`.
- [ ] Skill: one clause in `api-figure.md` naming `.pov` and `.glb`, tagged
  with what was rendered.

## Acceptance

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_render_structure.py tests/test_structure3d_browser.py tests/test_gui_manual.py -n auto --dist loadgroup
npx gltf-validator tests/output/figure3d/<case>.glb
povray +W1000 +H600 tests/output/figure3d/<case>.pov
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests examples
npm --prefix gui test && npm --prefix gui run check
```

The chiral phase renders the same hand in POV-Ray as in the PNG. The
validator reports no errors. Blender opens the `.glb` with the figure's
camera and renders it in Cycles.

## Handover log

### 2026-10-02 — filed

The maintainer asked whether the structure figure could go to Blender for
ray tracing. The figure's scene is plain geometry in Å, and every atom and
bond is an exact quadric, so a POV-Ray scene can draw it exactly and a glTF
can carry it into Blender with its camera. This WP writes both, and gives
the GUI a menu for them. Nothing is built.

- **Filed** because no open WP owns an export format.
- **Checked**: `povray` 3.7.0.10 and `blender` 5.2.2 install from Homebrew,
  `gltf-validator` is on npm, `rsvg-convert` and Inkscape are installed
  here. None is installed for the tests.
- **Next**: the `.pov` writer and its handedness test, which is the trap
  most likely to pass unnoticed.
