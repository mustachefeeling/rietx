# WP-1901 — the difference-Fourier map: a missing atom shows as a peak

Milestone: v1.9 · Status: ⬜
Depends on: —
Priority: P3 2026-09-30 — a view over what a converged fit already knows, and the first user-visible rung of the structure-solution milestone

## Goal

`solve/fourier.py` computes an observed and a difference electron-density map
from a converged Rietveld fit and lists its peaks with a significance. A phase
missing one atom shows that atom as the top difference peak.

## Context

Scoped in issue #562 (chunk S1) and WP-1515, reviewed adversarially on
2026-09-30. #197 leaves the fence with direct-space solution (decided
2026-09-30, `docs/DESIGN.md` § Structure fence revised). **Maximum-entropy maps
stay fenced.**

Amendments from the review:

- **A free function, not a `Refinement` method.** `refine.py` is busy with v1.6
  (PR #546 edits it) and the issue's own note calls it so. A method can follow.
- **The public test is NAC with one atom removed**, single line and public
  (`tests/data/11BM_NAC.fxye`). The proposal's PbSO₄ case needs a `.gpx` that is
  not vendored.
- `crystallography/structure_factor.py` has `_structure_factors_ab` (line 285 on
  `4de25284`, re-find it); the phase list is what a map needs, so a small public
  alias is the one edit outside `solve/`. Check that no v1.6 PR touches it.
- **State the phase convention when f″ ≠ 0**: A against A + iB. The package
  returns the Friedel average (root CLAUDE.md § anomalous scattering).
- Carry `structure_intensity_partition`'s documented model bias into every map
  record, and never let the map be the evidence of its own fit (a model-biased
  map flatters the model that partitioned it).

### Inherited

- **2026-10-02, from the issue triage (issue #653): the GUI panel this WP
  fences out has a written proposal.** It draws the maps this WP computes in
  the structure viewer and in `render_structure`: ΔF isosurfaces at ±nσ with
  a slider in σ units, the peak list as linked markers, a slice plane, the
  structure's own extent rules, and the map's caveats on screen (model bias,
  d_min and completeness, negative nuclear density being real for negative-b
  species). The package computes the mesh and the browser draws triangles,
  per WP-1015's rule; mesh against a ~1 MB 64³ grid is to be measured. It is
  **not this WP's scope**, and nothing here changes. It reaches this WP in one
  place: the map's grid, σ and peak list are the inputs the panel would read,
  so keep them a public return rather than a private intermediate. File the
  panel as its own WP when this one closes, from #653's text.

## Non-goals

- Charge flipping, direct space, the cost function (WP-1902 and later).
- A GUI panel, a skill reference, a capabilities flag.

## Tasks

- [ ] `solve/fourier.py`: F_obs and F_calc maps from a fit, peak picking, a significance in σ of the map
- [ ] The alias in `structure_factor.py`
- [ ] Tests: NAC minus one atom puts the top ΔF peak within 0.10 Å of the removed site and above 3σ; the intact model has no peak above the threshold; the observed map has NAC's six maxima at the six sites
- [ ] Skill: a routing row only if it ships a public entry point, otherwise none

## Acceptance

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_fourier_map.py -q
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests examples
```

- **2026-09-30** — created, from the 2026-09-30 issue triage (issues #562,
  #197). No open WP owns it.
