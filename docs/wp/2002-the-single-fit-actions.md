# WP-2002 — The single-fit actions: what one stage decides for the caller

Milestone: generality · Status: ⬜
Track: The audits
Depends on: 2001
Priority: P2 2026-10-18 — upstream of 2003 and 2004 (every fit runs these), and the seam the maintainer named first

## Goal

Every automatic action a single fit takes is in the audit table with a tier: the three
holds, the release and the collapse restore, the bound test, the phase-significance test,
the seeds, and the thresholds they rest on. Each tier-3 action either carries its two
grounds and the maintainer's dated approval, or is demoted by its kind of ambiguity
(DESIGN.md § Rules, 1): to a ranking with evidence where the data can rank the
alternatives, otherwise to the number in a record field with its meaning. The clash table
names every pair that interact.

## Context

The rule is `../milestones/generality.md` § The rule; 2001 restates it. This WP applies it
to `Refinement._run_stage` (`src/rietx/refine.py`, ~line 3795) and what it calls, and to
`src/rietx/strategy/` (`staged.py`, `magnetic.py`, `fraction_profile.py`,
`parameter_interval.py`, `suggest.py`), five files the first plan left unowned. The six
codes `strategy/magnetic.py` (five) and `strategy/fraction_profile.py` (one) raise are
this WP's too, since no code audit's seam reaches `strategy/`. Two of the five,
`LANDE_G_ASSUMED` and `MAGNETIC_ION_ASSUMED`, are also raised in
`crystallography/magcif.py`; this WP tiers them on both raise sites and 2006 reads the
row rather than writing one (fourth review).

**Why first.** `_run_stage` runs inside every fit the package makes, including the ones it
makes for itself: the report's rival fits (`report/layer2.py`, `report/body_misfit.py`),
the extinction screen (`indexing/extinction.py`), `strategy/magnetic.py`'s trials, and
every pattern of a chain. So 2003 and 2004 read a tree this WP has settled.

**The inventory, from the record fields** (the house rule makes every action leave one;
keyword counts over the source are mostly comments and were discarded at the open):

- `StageResult.held` / `held_reach`: the absent-phase hold (WP-1301, `_answer_significance`
  at ~line 1690: a scale under 3σ of its counting-noise esd), the moment hold (WP-1327),
  and the scale–B ridge hold (WP-1534, `SCALE_B_SEPARATION_FLOOR = 2·√PINV_RCOND` at
  ~line 542, which inherits `PINV_RCOND`'s tier). All three at ~lines 3938–3962.
- `StageResult.released` and the collapse restore: a phase that appeared is released; one
  that collapsed while solving is restored to where the stage found it and held, one extra
  solve (WP-1301).
- `StageResult.blocked_by_hold`: a user hold blocking a plan glob (WP-1435). Tier 1 by
  inspection (the user asked), but confirm.
- `StageResult.seeded`, `Stage.seed`, `Stage.strain_seed`: a row on a floor lifted before
  the solve; the Stephens isotropic seed (tier 1: at S ≡ 0 the √ has unbounded slope).
- `staged.bound_findings`, `at_bound`, `BOUND_HIT` / `FLOOR_HIT` (WP-1434, WP-1929): exact
  where the LM active set is exact; elsewhere "within a hundredth of an esd *and*
  `residual_cosine` not orthogonal", both measured into a window on one or two suites.
- `RefinementPlan.intermediate_ftol` (1e-6 vs 1e-9, WP-1123): a schedule, bounded for one
  fit at ≤ 0.03 esd; candidate for the answer-invariant class if the bound holds, tier 3
  otherwise.
- `background/auto.py`'s `auto_background` and `select.py`'s order scan: a verb whose job
  is the pick, returning its score table beside the choice. The record § A pick on top of
  a ranking allows that while no default path calls the verb; confirm it (no caller in
  `refine.py` or `strategy/` on 2026-10-18), then tier `AIR_SCATTER_TRIGGER`,
  `HUMP_TRIGGER` and the whiteness stop as the pick's thresholds.
- The flat-plate thickness test (`ABSORPTION_PLATE_THICKNESS`, an inline `< 0.7` at ~line
  6819) and the other inline literals near it: 2005 owns the codes, this WP owns any
  literal that gates an *action*.
- Every constant in `refine.py` and `strategy/` from 2001's AST walk that a hold, release,
  seed or bound test reads; and the constants of `optimize/statistics.py` that are not
  report-facing (`PINV_RCOND`, `COLUMN_SAFE_EXPONENT`, `MAX_SHIFT_CONVERGED`) plus
  `optimize/lm.py`'s `BVLS_MAX_COLUMNS`, which the bound test rests on. 2001's walk
  enters all of these at `unaudited` (`optimize/` and `background/` are on `_audit.WALKED`);
  this WP owns every `background/` constant and every `optimize/` constant that is not
  report-facing, 2004 the report-facing ones (2001 § The seams, the partition by
  directory). Never add a row by hand for a name the walk already entered.

**The two cases the second review named, to anchor the batch.** The absent-phase hold is
the one the rule keeps: a cell 14.9 Å from truth over 13 sub-onset patterns when free
(the v1.3 row), invisible in the outputs because Rwp does not move. The clash the review
found: WP-1320 chose the fraction profile's axis because the collapse rule fought it
(`strategy/fraction_profile.py` ~lines 13–22). A clash table is part of this WP's output.

**Evidence on disk.** Families for the mechanical ground: the four round-robin standards
(`tests/data/qarr`), the Durham tutorials (`~/rietx-local-data`, `python -m
tests.local_data`), the FAP suite, the private corpus files (cited by number, map in
`yue-here/rietx-corpus-map`). Tier-2 evidence: GSAS-II 5.8.4 source in
`~/Code/rietx-bench/tools/gsas2`, FullProf `fp2k` in `tools/fullprof`, the TOPAS
technical reference (memory `foreign-code-sources-on-disk`). "GSAS-II computes it" is not
"GSAS-II acts on it by default".

### Inherited

(none at filing)

## Non-goals

- The chain: rungs, quarantine, the reseed fence, the moment-floor carry
  (`sequential._floor_unsupported_moments`), `_prefer`/`_better`. 2003.
- The FitReport's gates and the report's rival fits as *consumers* of the holds. 2004.
- `refine.py`'s 61 diagnostic codes as codes. 2005. A literal that gates an action is
  this WP's; one that gates a diagnostic is 2005's.
- Redesigning a hold. An action the batch rejects is demoted; a replacement is a
  follow-up WP filed from the table.

## Tasks

- [ ] Inventory: one row per action and per constant it reads, from the record fields and
      2001's walk, with the file and line, what it decides, and what the caller sees
      without it. Lanes read disjoint files; the lead assembles.
- [ ] Tier each row per part (statistic, threshold, action), with evidence: the citation,
      the program and its default behaviour, or the families measured. Where the families
      are fewer than three, run the missing ones (the fits are cheap; a chain family is
      2003's).
- [ ] The clash table: every pair of actions that read or move the same parameter, with
      the measured interaction (Rwp and the parameter, both orderings).
- [ ] The batch to the maintainer, in the register of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: per tier-3
      row the two grounds answered (for the judgement ground, the dissenting caller named
      or declared absent), the Rule 1 kind it falls to if demoted, the case against
      drafted by the `generality-review` agent, and a recommendation. Rows resting on one evidence base are grouped and ruled as a class
      (record § Decisions); rulings dated into the table.
- [ ] Approved demotions: the action removed, and its number left in the record field (or
      its ranking returned) with its meaning in the package's own output; the code's
      `level` to `info` or the code removed where the threshold was its trigger. Each as
      its own commit.
- [ ] Goldens: every pinned number that moved, re-pinned only if no further from its
      reference; old, new, dataset and reference distance in the handover. A number that
      moved away goes back through the two grounds.
- [ ] `intermediate_ftol` and any other candidate for the answer-invariant class: the
      invariance test, or the row tiered.
- [ ] `tests/test_compare_ui.py` and `rietx compare`: a demoted action is a variant the
      comparison can show; add a row where a standard exercises it.
- [ ] Tests + obs/calc/diff PNGs to `tests/output/` for every refit used as evidence.
- [ ] Skill: none here. A demoted verdict's meaning goes into the package's own output and
      never into a skill row (DESIGN.md § Rules, 3; the record § Decisions, the skill's
      role). List each skill row that named a demoted verdict, for 2008.

## Acceptance

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_audit_table.py -q          # no refine.py/strategy row at unaudited
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -n auto --dist loadgroup -m "not slow"
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -n auto --dist loadgroup                # once, on the final tree: goldens
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests examples
```

The handover carries the clash table and the batch's rulings; the record's acceptance
row "no tier-3 action runs by default without its approval" is checked against the table
for every row this WP owns.

## Handover log

- **2026-10-18** — created, from the milestone's opening session (WP-2001's log has the
  measurements and the two reviews). No open WP owns the holds as a class: 1301 and 1534
  each shipped one and are closed. 1327, which shipped the moment hold, is still in flight
  (its analytic moment branch remains), so merge main before touching that hold and read
  1327's handover for what its branch moves.
