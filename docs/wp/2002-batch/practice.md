# What the seven programs do by default (2026-10-21)

Surveyed for the fifth round's questions and for tier 2's widened program list
(`docs/milestones/generality.md` § The rule). One agent per program read its manual or
source and, where cheap, ran it. The lead checked the load-bearing numbers against the
reports. Versions: GSAS-II 5.8.4 (source), FullProf 8.20 (manual and `fp2k` runs), TOPAS
Technical Reference Version 9 (no source or `Topas.inc` read), RIETAN-FP 3.12 (manual and
runs), BGMN 4.2.23 with Profex 5.7.2 (manual, Profex docs and templates, runs; no source,
GPL), MAUD 3.07 (BSD-3 source at the tag), EasyDiffraction 0.21.1 with cryspy 0.13.0
(source). Paths and line numbers are in each lane's notes under the session scratchpad and
are not reproduced. "Checked" means read in the source or manual; "ran" means measured.

## How far a peak is computed

The Lorentzian column is the area a pure Lorentzian loses to the default cut.

| Program | Default cut | Lorentzian area lost | When the window is set |
|---|---|---|---|
| rietx | `WINDOW_AREA_TOL`, 2 % of each peak's own area | 2 % | once per stage, at the stage's start (checked) |
| TOPAS | `ymin_on_ymax` 0.001 of the strongest line's height | 2.0 % | peak buffer rebuilt when a width moves past `aberration_range_change_allowed`, and per derivative for width parameters (§7.4, §7.7, checked) |
| MAUD | ±30 HWHM (±15 FWHM) | 2.1 % | every evaluation, finite-difference columns included (checked) |
| RIETAN-FP | `PC` 0.002 of each peak's own height, in three of four shipped examples; no default | 2.8 % | every evaluation (ran) |
| FullProf | `Wdt` × FWHM each side; no default, floored at 3; examples 3-15, PbSO₄ 6 | 5.3 % at 6 (10.5 % at 3, 2.1 % at 15) | once per run, at the starting widths (`Ias = 0`, ran); `Ias = 1` lags one cycle |
| GSAS-II | 50 FWHM below, 75 above | 0.53 % | every evaluation (checked) |
| BGMN | no cut seen out to 22° from a peak | ~0 | not documented |
| EasyDiffraction | none (cryspy sums every reflection over every point); the crysfml calculator uses 30 FWHM | 0 (1.1 %) | every evaluation (checked) |

## Axial divergence quadrature

| Program | Method |
|---|---|
| rietx | FCJ, node count from `NODES_PER_FWHM` etc., frozen per stage |
| GSAS-II | FCJ, Gauss-Legendre per profile point, count from the angular gap over the width, rounded up to a table, capped at 400; single precision (checked) |
| RIETAN-FP | FCJ, Gauss-Legendre per reflection, 10 to 100 nodes; Howard's model by Simpson with 3 to 9 terms (checked) |
| TOPAS | `axial_conv` (Cheary & Coelho 1998) by `axial_n_beta` rays, no printed default |
| FullProf | FCJ under `Npr = 7`; quadrature not documented |
| MAUD, EasyDiffraction (cryspy) | no FCJ; an empirical or Bérar-Baldinozzi asymmetry |
| BGMN | ray-traced instrument function, computed once before the fit and held |

## Reflections past the fitted range

| Program | Margin |
|---|---|
| rietx | `REFLECTION_MARGIN_DEG` 0.5° each side |
| TOPAS | `extra_X_left`, `extra_X_right` 0.5° each side (checked) |
| GSAS-II | none: a reflection must lie strictly inside the limits (checked) |
| RIETAN-FP | none: a reflection centred outside is dropped with its tails (ran) |
| FullProf | 3 × `Wdt` × FWHM above the upper limit (1.8° on PbSO₄); none below the lower (ran) |
| MAUD | `cutoff` × 0.1°, 3° at the default (checked) |
| EasyDiffraction | 4° in 2θ each side of the included points (checked) |
| BGMN | about the Kα₁-Kα₂ split, 0.05° at 30° to 0.6° at 150° (ran) |

## Staging and what a stage holds

| Program | Staging | Held during a fit |
|---|---|---|
| rietx | plans of cumulative stages; the last frees everything the plan freed | reflection list, windows, FCJ nodes: per stage |
| RIETAN-FP | `NAUTO = 2`: early cycles refine subsets (background and scale; widths; asymmetry; widths and asymmetry; cell; atoms), then everything together to convergence. `NAUTO = 1`: the user lists the early cycles | windows follow every evaluation; Le Bail intensities per cycle |
| BGMN | automatic: isotropic models first, anisotropic ones added, then a closing run with everything free restarted from the answer; a weak anisotropic term is switched off | the ray-traced instrument function for the whole fit |
| MAUD | the refinement wizard: cumulative stages (scales and background; cell, zero, B; size and strain; atoms), no final all-free cycle | windows follow every evaluation; texture, strain, Le Bail intensities and structure factors per iteration |
| FullProf | none; the user runs successive files in the manual's advised order | windows and point assignment for the whole run (`Ias = 0`) |
| GSAS-II | none; scripting takes a user list | the reflection list per `Refine` call; windows every evaluation |
| TOPAS | none; `_rem` and `quick_refine` drop parameters for an iteration | the peak buffer up to its tolerances |
| EasyDiffraction | none | nothing: reflection list and windows rebuilt every evaluation |

None of the seven tests whether its answer depends on the path or the start, and none of
their manuals discusses it.

## Surface roughness starting values

| Program | Pitschke | Suortti | Default start |
|---|---|---|---|
| rietx | `RoughnessPitschke` | `RoughnessSuortti` | c and b seeded at 0.3 by the roughness stage |
| RIETAN-FP | yes | yes (and Sparks, Sidey) | none given |
| FullProf | the P₀, Cp, τ form | no | none; shipped examples start Cp 1.23-1.50, τ 0.134-0.145 |
| TOPAS | `Surface_Roughness_Pitschke_et_al` | `Surface_Roughness_Suortti` | not in the reference (in `Topas.inc`, not read) |
| GSAS-II | no | `SurfaceRough` | SRA = SRB = 0, not refined |
| BGMN, MAUD, EasyDiffraction | no | no | |

## Peak-width limits

| Program | U, V, W, X, Y limits | Negative width | Sample-broadening limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| rietx | floors only since 2026-10-21 | Γ_G² clamped at 1e-8 deg² | `lor_size` etc. by their own schema |
| GSAS-II | none | Gaussian variance and Lorentzian width floored per reflection | none |
| FullProf | none | Γ_G set to 1e-10 with a message; peaks vanish (ran) | none |
| RIETAN-FP | none | refused at the start; a step to one is rejected | none |
| TOPAS | no u-y rows in Table 2-1; opt-in `force_positive_fwhm` | undocumented | `CS_L` 0.3 nm to min(2·Val + 0.3, 10 000) |
| MAUD | ±0.5, ±0.3, ±0.1 on U, V, W, not enforced by its least squares | floored at 1e-7° | size 50-5000 Å, strain ≤ 0.005, not enforced |
| EasyDiffraction | none | H_G² floored at machine ε; a negative H_L passes | none |
| BGMN | no Caglioti widths | fatal error | Profex writes B1 ≤ 0.01 and k2 ≤ 1e-4 into the files it creates |

## The tier-2 rows resting on a program default

| Row | Programs that agree | Dissent |
|---|---|---|
| `Source:dispersion` (f′, f″ on for X-rays) | all seven (BGMN through the `.ano` table its default `LAMBDA=CU` names; other line files drop it silently) | none |
| `mode` rows (Rietveld) | GSAS-II, MAUD, EasyDiffraction, BGMN (Le Bail only with no atoms); FullProf, RIETAN-FP and TOPAS make the user state it | none |
| `two_theta_limits` rows (the full range) | GSAS-II, FullProf, RIETAN-FP, MAUD, EasyDiffraction; BGMN takes the instrument function's range | none |
| `refine:solver` (Marquardt-damped) | GSAS-II, TOPAS, RIETAN-FP, MAUD, EasyDiffraction, BGMN (regularised Gauss-Newton) | FullProf: Gauss-Newton with relaxation factors, undamped |
| `_TCH_ETA`, `_TCH_GAMMA` | GSAS-II, FullProf, RIETAN-FP, EasyDiffraction, TOPAS (whose §7.2 prints the cubic η term as 0.1116, likely a misprint of 0.11116) | none; MAUD and BGMN do not use TCH |
| `CELL_MIN_LENGTH_A` (1.5 Å) | TOPAS | none floor a cell length; the floor binds on no real cell |
| `auto_background:seed` (not from the data) | all seven start from zero, a constant or the user's numbers | none |
| `BRINDLEY_MU_R_FENCE` | the citation; FullProf prints the same classes as text | not asked of the others |

Found beside the questions, for rietx-bench rather than rietx: its BGMN case names
`LAMBDA=cu_hoelzer97`, which has no `.ano` table, so that run has no anomalous dispersion
(12 % of |F| on Pb (101)), while its `engine.toml` says it uses `cu.ano`.
