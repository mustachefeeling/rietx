"""Pattern file readers — the front door.

The parsers themselves live one per module in :mod:`rietx.io.formats`; this
module is the entry point every caller uses (:func:`read_pattern`,
:func:`identify_format`) plus the re-exports that keep ``rietx.io.readers``
the address it has always been for ``PatternFormat``, ``PATTERN_FORMATS`` and
:func:`read_pdcif`.

Which formats, and how each is recognised, is :mod:`rietx.io.formats`'
business — including why the registry's *order* is behaviour rather than
presentation.  When the file carries per-point esds (or least-squares weights,
from which σ = 1/√w) they are stored in ``PatternData.sigma`` — never overridden
by the Poisson fallback (review finding M5).

    """Read any supported pattern file, dispatching on *content* first.

    GSAS raw files are recognised by their ``BANK`` record rather than by
    suffix — the format is written with a zoo of extensions (``.fxye``,
    ``.gsas``, ``.gda``, ``.xra``, ``.raw``, …) and the record is unambiguous.

    ``options`` are the reader keywords in :data:`READER_OPTIONS` — ``block``
    for a pdCIF's data block, and later the ``scan`` a multi-scan vendor file
    holds several of.  They are named rather than positional precisely so a
    caller (or a project reopening its own pattern) need not know which reader
    will claim the file: an option this format does not take is dropped, while
    an option *no* format takes is a typo and raises.  See
    :func:`~rietx.io.formats.base.reader_options_for` for that distinction.

    ``diagnostics``, when a list is passed, collects what the reader **repaired
    or assumed** — a scan stored high→low and reversed, a duplicated point
    dropped, an option that did not apply.  It is the same channel
    :func:`~rietx.crystallography.cif.structure_from_cif` takes and exists
    for the same reason: a reader is the one layer that may silently correct a
    stranger's file, and it may only do so where it can say that it did.
    Returning a bare :class:`PatternData` was an accident, not a design.

    ``PATTERN_DEAD_CHANNELS`` is the one entry on that channel that is neither
    a repair nor an assumption, and it is here rather than only at compile
    because of *when* it is useful: a dead detector cell reaches the person as
    fourteen parameters at their bounds several minutes later, and none of the
    fourteen is the problem (issue #274).  It is format-agnostic — a dead cell
    is a property of the measurement and not of the file — so it is raised
    once here rather than in each reader, and only when a caller passed the
    list, which keeps it off the path of everyone who did not ask.

    **The axis every reader hands back is checked here**, whatever the format,
    because a wrong one parses perfectly: a GSAS file whose ``BANK`` record is
    missing falls to the ASCII reader and comes back in centidegrees, 100× too
    large (issue #230).  Two bands, split by the rule a reader's repairs
    follow (a contradiction raises, a report says so):

    - **past 180° raises**, naming the file, the reader and the range.  No
      scattering angle exceeds 180°, so the axis contradicts the claim that it
      is 2θ, and no exotic geometry makes it real;
    - **at or below 0° reports** ``PATTERN_X_AXIS_IMPLAUSIBLE`` and reads.  A
      scan through zero is geometrically real on a detector covering both
      sides, but no Bragg reflection lies there, and a header row read as data
      lands there too (issue #266's lands at exactly 0).

    The refusal runs on every call; the report, like the two below, only when
    a caller passed the list.

    ``PATTERN_SIGMA_CONSTANT`` is here for the dead-channel reason: a σ
    identical on every point makes the fit unweighted whichever reader
    produced it, so it is a property of the answer and not of one format.
    Issue #266 met it in ``xy``, which adopts any positive third column; on
    this hook it also reaches a GSAS esd column, a pdCIF weight loop and a
    ``.chi`` third column.  The σ is kept, because a uniform σ is legal.
