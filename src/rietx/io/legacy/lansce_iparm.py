"""The legacy LANSCE ``.iparm`` layout: :func:`read_lansce_iparm`.

The LANSCE NPDF instrument files this package's authors hold deviate from the
layout the GSAS Technical Manual documents (Larson & Von Dreele 2004,
LAUR 86-748, p. 221-223) in three ways, none described there.
:func:`rietx.io.instrument_tof.read_gsas_tof_iparm` refuses all three and
stays that way.  This reader accepts them on request, each reported as
``GSAS_IPARM_LEGACY_LAYOUT`` (level ``info``):

1. **An 8-coefficient type-1 ``PRCF`` block** — the default set declares
   ``PTYP 1, NCOF 8`` in two coefficient records, where the manual documents
   twelve names for profile function 1 (p. 144: ``alp-0 alp-1 bet-0 bet-1
   sig-0 sig-1 sig-2 s1ec s2ec rstr rsta rsca``).  **Read as slots 1-8 of the
   documented twelve**, slots 9-12 zero, by restating the header's ``NCOF`` as
   12 and adding a ``PRCFn3`` record of zeros, then handing the records to the
   strict reader's own body — so every column check, the anisotropic-term
   refusal (slot 8 is ``s1ec``) and the variance-sign check apply unchanged.
   **Slots 1, 5 and 8 are read as ``alp-0``, ``sig-0`` and ``s1ec`` because
   the manual's order is the source**: GSAS-II v5.8.2 (run 2026-09-23)
   carrying those three slots under no name is silence, not contradiction —
   and bank 4 of the real NPDF 7245 file has a non-zero ``alp-0``
   (7.19136e-4), which this reader reads and GSAS-II does not.
2. **A non-zero fifth ``ICOFF`` pair of ITYP 1/2** — P₁₀·exp(−P₁₁·T⁵), T in
   ms, whose exponent the manual's printed ladder stops short of and which
   was measured by conformance (:mod:`rietx.model.tof_spectrum`'s docstring;
   :data:`LANSCE_FIFTH_PAIR_EXPONENT`).  The model evaluates it; the strict
   reader refuses it because it holds to the documented layout, so this
   reader passes it through that reader's body with the one switch the body
   offers (``fifth_pair=True``) and nothing else changed.
3. **A ``BNKPAR`` value one field too wide** — NPDF 7245 bank 1 writes
   TTHETA ``46.60`` in columns 30-34, across the TTHETA/TILT boundary, which
   the strict column check refuses.  **That one record, and no other**, is
   re-read by whitespace tokens (up to five reals DIST TTHETA TILT SEPN HGHT,
   then up to two integers NTUBE ITUBE), each token restated right-aligned in
   its own columns and the record handed on; a token that is not a number of
   its field's kind, or does not fit its field, leaves the record as it was
   for the strict reader to refuse.  GSAS-II v5.8.2 reads that record as
   2θ = 46.6, the value the token read takes.

A file carrying none of the three is read by the strict reader and returned
exactly as it returns it.

**How the layout was confirmed — GSAS-II as a black box, nothing read.**
GSAS-II v5.8.2 (revision 5841), run under its own interpreter
(``~/.local/gsas2/bin/python``) on 2026-09-23 through its public scripting API
only: ``G2sc.G2Project(newgpx=…)``, ``.add_powder_histogram(flat.xye, file.prm,
fmthint="xye", instbank=b)``, then ``hist.data["Instrument Parameters"]`` and
``hist.getdata("X")``/``("Yobs")``.  On the NPDF run 7245 Si-standard
calibration, bank 1 (DIFC 6911.21, DIFA −2.79, ZERO −19.42, 2θ 46.60°) came
back ``alpha 0.146061, beta-0 0.0434277, beta-1
0.0233696, sig-0 0, sig-1 353.349, sig-2 0`` — slots 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 of its
8-slot block.  Synthetic files with a distinct sentinel in one slot at a time
place every slot (:data:`GSAS2_PRCF1_DESTINATIONS`): slots 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 land
under ``alpha, beta-0, beta-1, sig-1, sig-2``, and slots 1, 5, 8 under no name
at all — and a 12-slot type-1 block gives the same destinations slot for slot.
So GSAS-II reads the 8-slot block as the 12-slot block cut short, which is the
restatement above.  For the
spectrum, a flat synthetic pattern (y = 1000 everywhere) comes back as
1000/I_i(T), so GSAS-II's own incident spectrum is observable on its grid: it
equals this package's ITYP 1/2 law at GSAS-II's bin-centre ``X`` to 2e-16
relative, and a least-squares fit of the fifth term alone gives k = 5.000000
at three decades of P₁₁ (log-log residual ≤ 2e-11), on ITYP 1 and ITYP 2, and
on the real bank 2 (P₁₁ = 5.21191e-5; the term is 17 % of I_i there), residual
2e-13 and doubled by Δk ≈ 1.5e-15.  GSAS-II is an oracle for the file layout
and the incident spectrum only: its time-of-flight profile function has a known
Lorentzian-sign defect, so nothing here is checked against a peak shape it
computes.
