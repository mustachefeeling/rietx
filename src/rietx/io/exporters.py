"""Export a finished refinement in the forms other codes and people consume.

Three artefacts, all built from state the refinement already computed and would
otherwise discard:

- a **reflection table** — one row per (emission line, reflection): hkl, d, 2θ,
  |F|², integrated intensity, multiplicity, phase, line.  Every emission line
  gets its own rows (never only λ₁): the calculated pattern really has a peak at
  each Kα₂ position, and a λ₁-only table would misrepresent the model — the same
  reasoning that makes ``RefinementResult.ticks`` carry every line.
- a **refinement CIF** — the structure with refined values *and* standard
  uncertainties, plus R-factors, wavelength and a profile/background
  description, and the observed/calculated pattern as a pdCIF loop.  The pattern
  loop uses the tags ``io.readers.read_pdcif`` reads, so the package round-trips
  against itself (export → re-read is the cheapest correctness test).
- a **QPA table** — the Hill-Howard weight fractions, carrying the
  "crystalline modelled content only" caveat into the file, not just the API.

class ReflectionRow:
    """One (emission line, reflection) row of a reflection table.

    ``two_theta`` is the *apparent* position the model places the peak at
    (Bragg angle + zero shift + sample-displacement/transparency), matching the
    tick list — not the ideal Bragg angle.  ``f_squared`` is ``None`` in Le
    Bail/Pawley mode, where the per-reflection intensity is extracted or refined
    rather than computed from the structure.  ``intensity`` is the modelled
    integrated intensity of this (line, reflection): in Rietveld mode
    scale·multiplicity·|F|²·P·(line weight)·Lp·extinction·absorption·roughness.

    **On a phase carrying moments, ``f_squared`` is not that |F|²** (issue
    #613).  The intensity is built from ⟨|F_N|²⟩ + p²⟨|F_⊥|²⟩, and on a
    ``"total"`` row — every row of a phase whose magnetic width is at its off
    state — ``f_squared`` is the **nuclear** ⟨|F_N|²⟩ alone.  A magnetic-only
    reflection (a nuclear absence the magnetic group allows: MnF₂'s (1 0 0) under
    136.499) therefore carries ``f_squared == 0`` beside one of the pattern's
    largest intensities.  The magnetic share is in ``intensity``; it gets its
    own row, ``component == "magnetic"`` with ``f_squared`` = p²⟨|F_⊥|²⟩, only
    where the phase's magnetic width is active.

    With anomalous scattering on, ``f_squared`` is the **Friedel-averaged**
    ⟨|F|²⟩ = ½(|F(h)|² + |F(−h)|²) that the powder peak actually contains, not
    the representative reflection's own |F(h)|² — the two differ in a
    non-centrosymmetric group, and only the average is observable in a powder
    (see ``crystallography.structure_factor``).

    Tag names are the COMCIFS core dictionary's, checked rather than
    remembered (as WP-1069 did for the R factors): the ``_geom_bond.*``,
    ``_geom_contact.*`` and ``_geom_angle.*`` categories, written in the flat
    DDL1 alias spelling the rest of this block uses.  McCusker §11 asks for
    "both bonding and nonbonding" distances, which is exactly the split
    between the first two categories; ``_geom_angle`` carries only the bonded
    ones, because an angle between two contacts is not a shape anybody reads.
    A bonded row and an angle carry ``publ_flag yes`` and a contact ``no``,
    the dictionary's default (ITC Vol. G ch. 4.1, pp. 236-238).

    :class:`~rietx.schemas.results.GeometryTable` lists every atom's whole
    environment, so a bond between two sites is in it twice, once from each
    end.  **One direction is dropped here**: the CIF convention is that a bond
    appears once, and a consumer summing rows per atom (bond valences, say)
    would double-count otherwise.  Which direction survives is the atoms'
    order in the phase, and a same-site pair keeps both rows because they are
    two different bonds rather than one bond twice.

    A ``_geom_*_site_symmetry_*`` code is an index into a **listed** operation
    order.  The structure block (:func:`rietx.io.cif.blocks.write_structure_block`)
    writes that list on every block, in
    :func:`~rietx.model.geometry.symmetry_operations`' order over the group
    :func:`~rietx.crystallography.symmetry.resolve_group` returns, which is the
    order the bond search indexed.  So this writes no second loop.  The codes
    are part of each category's key in ``cif_core.dic``, and a key cannot be
    unknown, so a row whose image needs a lattice shift the one-digit code
    cannot express is left out of the loop and counted in
    ``_geom_special_details`` (issue #756 § 6), where it was ``?`` before.

    Standard uncertainties ride in the value as ``1.8548(12)``, the notation
    :func:`~rietx.crystallography.cif.format_su` writes for every other
    refined number here — never a separate ``_su`` column that a reader may or
    may not pick up.  A row whose esd is ``None`` (nothing it depends on was
    refined, or symmetry fixes it) is written as a plain number rather than an
    invented zero, its shortest ``repr`` (:func:`rietx.io.cif.numbers.number`),
    and ``_geom_special_details`` says so with the method (McCusker et al. 1999
    § 10).
