"""GSAS raw powder data — the FXYE / ESD / STD bank formats.

Spec: Larson & Von Dreele (2004), *GSAS — General Structure Analysis System*,
LAUR 86-748, §"Powder data file formats".

Recognised by its ``BANK`` record rather than by suffix: the format is written
with a zoo of extensions (``.fxye``, ``.gsas``, ``.gda``, ``.xra``, ``.raw``, …)
and the record is unambiguous.  That is also what keeps it disjoint from the
Bruker binary ``.raw``, which is claimed by magic bytes — a GSAS file named
``.raw`` still reaches this reader, and a Bruker file named ``.gsas`` does not.

**The bank record makes two independent declarations and they are read as two.**
The **bintype** says how the x axis is computed; the **type flag** (``STD``,
``ESD``, ``FXYE``, and also ``ALT`` and ``FXY``) says how one data record is laid
out.  Nothing couples them — an ``ESD`` record holds (intensity, esd) pairs
whichever bintype it sits under — so a reader that lets one decide the other
returns a wrong pattern rather than a refusal.  This one did: a non-``CONS`` bank
was *forced* into the FXYE branch behind a divisible-by-three check on its value
count, which a ``RALF`` bank carrying ESD data passes whenever its pair count is
a multiple of three.

**The bintype decides which quantity the x axis holds, and this reader now has
two places to put one.**  ``CONS``/``CONST`` is 2θ — the two spellings are one
rule, a start angle and a step both in centidegrees, and that rule is what the
centidegree fold below rests on.  ``TIME_MAP``, ``RALF`` and ``SLOG`` are
neutron flight times in microseconds and land on ``PatternData.tof``.  The
manual's remaining five put something this package still has nowhere to keep:
another flight time on a clock whose table this reader cannot build (``LOG6``),
a d-spacing (``COND``), a Q (``CONQ``), a detector position (``LPSD``) or a
photon energy (``EDS``), and each is refused by name saying what its axis
actually holds — the third row of the axis policy (``io/CLAUDE.md`` § The axis
is never trusted) reached through the bintype instead of through an axis label.

**A bank is a detector, so which bank is a choice and it is the caller's.**
``read_gsas(path, bank=n)`` selects the record whose own ``BANK`` line declares
*n* — the number a GSAS instrument-parameter file's per-bank ``INS`` records use
too, never a position in the file — and a file holding **several** banks with no
``bank`` is refused naming them.  Returning the first was harmless only while
every readable bank was one 2θ scan of one specimen; a six-bank Mantid
``SaveGSS`` file, which is the ordinary ISIS GEM export, is six detectors with
six scattering angles and six DIFCs, and answering with bank 1 is the silent
selection ``instrument_profile.read_gsas_prm`` refuses a multi-bank file to
avoid.  Measured: a whole real refinement was worked around by splitting such a
file into six single-bank files by hand.  :func:`gsas_banks` is what makes the
choice offerable, and a single-bank file needs no ``bank`` and is unchanged.

**The bintype also decides the fold, which is the trap this format sets.**  The
manual says an FXYE x column is *"centidegrees for CW data or microseconds for
TOF data"* — one column, two units, and nothing in the numbers to tell them
apart: a TOF range of 1000-10000 µs read as centidegrees is a flawless-looking
10-100° scan.  **The reference implementation has the bug**: GSAS-II's
``G2pwd_fxye`` divides by 100 unconditionally, with no bintype branch anywhere
in the module.  So "implement it the way GSAS-II does" was never available, and
the fold is taken off the bintype here, once, beside the axis decision itself.

The match is **exact and never a prefix**, because ``COND`` and ``CONQ`` share
three characters with ``CONS`` and are two of the axes this refuses.

**A time-of-flight axis is read only where the file states it exactly**, which
is not the same as every TOF bank:

- **``TIME_MAP``** tabulates its steps in a separate record — triples of
  (first channel, flight time, step) in clock units, then a terminator — so the
  axis is a table lookup and is exact.  Read in all three record layouts.
  Measured against a real LANSCE NPDF bank (Si standard, 4 banks × 6537
  channels): the 240-triple map reproduces the declared channel count exactly
  and its d-spacings match Si to 7 × 10⁻⁴ rms.
- **``RALF``/``SLOG``** carry *binning constants*, not a table, and are read
  only from an **FXYE** record — the layout that writes its own x column, which
  is what Mantid's ``SaveGSS`` (whose default format is ``RALF``) actually
  writes.  Under ``ESD``/``STD`` the axis would have to be synthesized from the
  four coefficients, and that is refused rather than approximated: the manual
  itself says a ``RALF`` step "varies (irregularly) in pseudoconstant Δt/t
  steps", and reconstructing an ISIS GEM bank's axis from its own coefficients
  (start 35328/32 = 1104 µs, Δt/t = 0.004) reproduces the file's explicit
  column only to ~9 × 10⁻³ µs — a **near miss**, which is the one error shape
  a synthesized axis must not have, since nothing downstream can see it.

Real files are not scarce, which is why none of this is hypothetical: GSAS-II's
own tutorial data ships ``SLOG`` and ``RALF`` banks, and on the code this
replaces several read as plausible wrong 2θ patterns — an ISIS PEARL ``RALF``
bank came back as a flawless-looking 2528-point scan from 15.00° to 194.88°,
which no caller could have told from a real one.  **The reference implementation
has the same bug**: the manual says an FXYE x column is *"centidegrees for CW
data or microseconds for TOF data"*, and GSAS-II's ``G2pwd_fxye`` divides by 100
unconditionally, with no bintype branch anywhere in the module.  So "implement it
the way GSAS-II does" was never available — it would have shipped this exact
wrong answer.

**And only ``STD``/``ESD``/``FXYE`` records are read, with every other flag
refused by name.**  ``STD`` is also what a bank that states *no* flag means —
four obtainable real files write the record that way — and that default is why an
unrecognised flag was silent: an ``ALT`` or ``FXY`` bank fell through to
counts-only with an axis synthesized from ``c1``/``c2``, so its own x column
entered the intensity array and a wrong axis took its place.  The symptom was
visible in the output all along: the pattern came back tagged ``gsas-alt``, the
reader having used the flag as a label rather than as a decision.

Neither layout is *implemented*, and here the reason really is the fixture.
Every ``ALT`` file obtainable is also a ``RALF`` bank, so it is refused one
decision earlier for its bintype and cannot exercise an ``ALT`` reader at all;
and no ``FXY`` file was found anywhere.  A record layout is exactly the kind of
fact a fixture is for, so both are named and declined rather than written against
a description.

**And the three layouts that are read differ in whether a field has a position
or only a separator** — behaviour, not style, because it decides whether a
full-width value can fuse with its neighbour:

- **ESD** is positional, written by a Fortran ``FORMAT``: ten 8-character
  fields to an 80-column record, five (intensity, esd) pairs.  Three
  descriptions agree and so does every real file (§ ``_esd_fields``).
- **FXYE** / **FXY** are free-format, one point to a line, and are read by
  splitting on whitespace.  That is the spec's word (GSAS-II splits them) and
  the fixtures corroborate it: ``mg090.fxye``'s tokens are 9 and 10 characters
  wide and its lines run 31–34 characters, so 8-character slicing would
  destroy it.
- **STD** is positional too, but its 8-character field is a 2-character repeat
  count followed by a 6-character value, so a value can never reach the field's
  left edge and **fusion is structurally impossible** in a bank GSAS could have
  written.  Whitespace splitting therefore reads an uncompressed STD bank
  exactly, which is what ``FAP.XRA`` is; the compressed variant is a separate
  question no obtainable file answers, and it is not silently guessed at here.

#: ``TIME_MAP`` tabulates it, the other two state constants a reader would have
#: to integrate.  ``SLOG``'s third coefficient is 4e-4 … 3e-3 across four
#: independent files and the channel ratio matches it, so it really is Δt/t and
#: not Δt.  ``RALF`` is deliberately *not* called log-step: it is constant-width
#: at short flight times and only pseudo-Δt/t beyond a coefficient that says
#: where — the ISIS GEM bank measured here (``BANK 1 797 797 RALF 35328 141
#: 35328 0.00400 FXYE``) puts that coefficient at the *start*, so that bank is
#: log-stepped throughout.  A ``TIME_MAP`` bank carries a map *number* where the

#: are tabulated elsewhere in the file.

#: The bintypes still refused, and what each one actually puts on the x axis.
#: None is a 2θ and none is a flight time this reader can establish, which is

#: clock table is not in the manual's data file at all; ``COND``/``CONQ``/
#: ``LPSD``/``EDS`` are quantities ``PatternData`` has no field for) rather than
#: of evidence.  Sources for the descriptions, since a wrong one in a refusal is
#: still a wrong statement: the bintype list and each definition are the GSAS
#: manual's (LAUR 86-748, §"Powder data file formats"), corroborated by real
#: bank records where one was obtainable.  And ``EDS`` is energy-dispersive, not
#: time-of-flight, which is why this is one table of five rather than a "TOF"
#: set.

#: The type flags named and refused, and what each one holds.  Both are a layout

#: an ``FXY`` record's x column doing the same while the axis is synthesized from
#: ``c1``/``c2`` in its place.  Neither is implemented, and here the reason is
#: the fixture: every obtainable ``ALT`` file is also a ``RALF`` bank, so it is
#: refused one decision earlier and cannot exercise an ``ALT`` reader at all, and
#: no ``FXY`` file was found anywhere.  The shapes are *known* — the manual gives
#: ALT as four ``(x, intensity, error)`` points to an 80-column record on a
#: 20-character stride, ``NREC = ceil(NCHAN/4)``, and FXY as two free-format
#: values — and knowing a shape is still not having a fixture to test it against.
#: Which matters here more than usual: for ALT the manual's own Fortran format
#: and GSAS-II's scale factors **disagree**, by 100× on x and 10× on y and esd,
#: so there is no reading of the two sources that is safe without a file.

#: Mantid's ``SaveGSS`` writes this sentence into its header **when, and only
#: when, it multiplied Y by the bin widths** — its ``MultiplyByBinWidth``
#: option, whose default is TRUE.  So on a file carrying it the ordinate is a
#: count per channel and the flight-time forward model owes it a factor of W
#: (``schemas.pattern.PatternData.intensity_basis``).  It is a **declaration**
#: in ``io/CLAUDE.md``'s first sense — a statement in the writer's own header
#: that cannot disagree with itself — and it was checked anyway, against the
#: one file that has a twin: an ISIS GEM ``.gss`` carrying the line and its
#: ``_tof.xye`` export of the same bank differ by exactly that bank's channel
#: width (Δt/t = 0.004; the first channel's 1.01737949 against 0.23038662 at
#: T = 1106.1995 µs is a ratio of 4.416 against a width of 4.425 µs).
#:
#: **Its absence says nothing**, and is not read as one.  A GSAS file written
#: by anything but Mantid has no such header at all, and no obtainable file
#: was written by ``SaveGSS`` with the option off, so "Mantid header, no such
#: line" has never been seen and is left undetermined rather than guessed.

    The decision only the bintype **and** the record layout can take together.
    An FXYE record carries its own x column, so any TOF bintype is exact under
    it.  A ``TIME_MAP`` bank tabulates its steps, so it is exact under any
    layout.  What is left — a ``RALF`` or ``SLOG`` bank of ESD pairs or bare
    counts — would need the axis integrated from the four bank coefficients,
    and neither can be done exactly:

    * ``RALF``'s own manual entry says the step "varies (**irregularly**) in
      pseudoconstant Δt/t steps" beyond its third coefficient, i.e. the
      coefficients describe the binning rather than define it.  Measured: an
      ISIS GEM bank's coefficients (start 35328/32 = 1104 µs, first width
      141/32 = 4.40625 µs, log part from 1104 µs, Δt/t = 0.004) reproduce that
      same bank's explicit FXYE column only to ~9 × 10⁻³ µs — 8 × 10⁻⁶ of the
      flight time, so every peak would land a fraction of a channel off with
      nothing downstream able to see it.
    * ``SLOG``'s Δt/t binning *is* exact arithmetic, and no file writing it
      under ESD or STD was obtainable — the same reason ``ALT`` and ``FXY`` are
      named and declined (§ the module docstring).  A record layout is exactly
      the kind of fact a fixture is for.

    So both are refused *for this layout only*, naming the layout that works,
    which is also the one their writer actually emits: Mantid's ``SaveGSS``
    defaults to ``RALF`` with ``DataFormat=FXYE``.
