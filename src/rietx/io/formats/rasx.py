"""Rigaku ``.rasx`` — the zip container SmartLab Studio II writes.

Spec: a zip whose member names and manifest were read off four real files.
Member paths and element names are interface facts, so they are written down
here and the parser below is this package's own::

    root.xml                            the manifest, UTF-8 with a BOM
      <Root Version="1.1.0.0">
        <Data0 Type="Profile">          one group per scan
          <ContentHashList Name="Profile0.txt" ContentHash="…" />
          <ContentHashList Name="MesurementConditions0.xml" ContentHash="…" />
    Data0/Profile0.txt                  2θ ⇥ intensity ⇥ attenuator, per line
    Data0/MesurementConditions0.xml     the header — note the misspelling

**The manifest is the authority on what the file holds**, not the zip's name
list: it gives the groups in order and says which member of each is the profile.
A member path is its group's element name, a slash, and the ``Name`` attribute —
which is how ``MesurementConditions0.xml`` is found without this module having
to be sure Rigaku will keep misspelling it.  A reciprocal-space map is 401
groups (``RSM_111_sdd=350.rasx``, recorded in ``tests/data/README.md``); they
are scans, selected with ``scan=`` and never joined.

**Nothing is extracted to disk and no member is read whole on trust.**
``ZipInfo.file_size`` is a number in the archive's own header — an attacker or a
corrupt writer supplies it — so each member is read through a cap and refused
past it, and ``extract()`` (which writes files, and historically wrote them
outside the destination) is never called.

**σ is the ``.ras`` arithmetic, and that is a correction to this WP's premise.**
The plan recorded cps as *verified by fixture* for this format.  It is not: of
the three real single-scan files, ``TwoTheta_scan_powder.rasx`` and
``Omega-2Theta_scan_high_temperature.rasx`` both declare
``<IntensityUnit>counts</IntensityUnit>`` and store values like 170.55354309082
that **no** scale in 1/400…400 (nor k/60, nor 60/k, nor the file's own 2.4 s
counting time) makes integral, while ``ZnO-ALD-training….rasx`` declares counts
and is integral to the last of 7001 points.  So this is the same free-text
declaration ``.ras`` gets wrong, in the same vendor's own embedded ``RASHeader``,
and it is decided the same way — by :func:`base.sigma_by_arithmetic`.
