"""``.pks`` / ``.udi`` — peak lists, declined on their name and saying so.

Stoe writes ``.pks`` and PANalytical writes ``.udi``; both are tables of
*reflections* rather than measured profiles, which is the same objection
``dif.py`` makes and for the same reason: refining against a few dozen delta
functions fits every background coefficient, width and scale to a picture of a
diffractogram and reports a plausible Rwp for it.

**What is different here is the evidence, and it is worth being explicit
about.**  ``.dif`` is matched on *content* — an hkl triple per row — because
real ``.dif`` files were available to write that test against.  No ``.pks`` or
``.udi`` sample could be obtained from anywhere, so the positive test cannot be
written and this entry matches on the **suffix**.  That is a weaker claim and
the refusal says so rather than implying a content test it did not do.

**The escape is kept, because a suffix is a filename.**  ``dif.py``'s docstring
is explicit that "a real profile that someone named ``.dif`` still falls
through to the ASCII reader and opens", and dropping that here would make a
genuine two-column scan a lab happened to name ``.pks`` unopenable.  So the
gate is negative: refuse on the suffix **unless** the file reads as a plain
two-column profile, in which case nothing is claimed and it reaches ``xy``.
"Plain" is the whole of the test — every non-comment line in the bounded head
being a row of two or three numbers — and a peak list fails it on its header
alone.  **Comment** means what ``xy`` means by it, the same four markers, since
this gate's only job is to predict whether that reader would open the file: a
two-column export with a ``#`` header is the commonest shape there is, and
counting those lines against it closed the escape for exactly the files it was
written to let out.

Revisit the day a real ``.pks`` or ``.udi`` turns up: with a sample the match
can become content-based like ``.dif``'s, and this module's whole reason for
being different disappears.
