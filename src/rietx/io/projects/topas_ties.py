"""The constraints a TOPAS file states, read back as rietx ties (#721 item 4).

A ``.inp`` states a constraint two ways (Technical Reference § 2.3): one
parameter **name** written at several values (``beq b_Fe 0.5`` on eight sites
is one B), and an **equation** over names (``mly = -mFe / 9.10;``). Reading
only the numbers returns every copy as an independent literal, which is the
model with its constraints dropped: a moment tied across eight sites comes back
as eight held numbers and a shared B as eight free ones (showcase row M6).

:func:`derive_ties` recovers the forms
:func:`~rietx.io.projects.topas.write_topas_inp` writes, and any file stating
the same forms: a value that is exactly a name, and an equation **affine** in
names (sums of ``c*name`` and a constant). Each name is carried by the first
value that is that name alone (``c·name + k``); every other value over it is an
affine tie on the carrier's path, ``Σ (c/c₀)·carrier + k'``, which is the shape
``Refinement.tie`` takes. A moment is the one non-affine case: its freedom in
rietx is a modulus and up to two angles (``crystallography.magnetic.moments``),
so a moment that is ``s`` times a carrier moment is tied as the modulus
``|s|·μ`` and, for ``s < 0``, the antipode (θ → π − θ, φ → φ + π). An equation
outside these forms keeps its value and is reported, never guessed at.

:func:`apply_ties` declares them on a ``Refinement``.
