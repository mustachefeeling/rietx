"""What a written TOPAS ``.inp`` refines, how its numbers are tied, and its scale.

:func:`~rietx.io.projects.topas.write_topas_inp` writes each ``Parameter``'s own
``vary``, and a plan-driven fit leaves every stored flag ``False`` (a plan
*replaces* the flags per stage; the free set lives in ``Refinement.parameters()``
and ``RefinementResult.parameters``, not on the models). Issue #722. Ties
(``Refinement.tie``/``tie_equal``, the symmetry ties of a special position, the
anti-translation partners of a supercell) have no written form either, so every
copy of a tied value would refine as its own parameter (#721 item 3).

:class:`RefinedSet` is the one place that answers both questions for a writer:

* **what refines** — the free set of the fit, read from what ``free=`` is given;
* **how a written number depends on it** — every written quantity is resolved,
  through the table's affine ties ``value = Σ c·source + k``, to an
  :class:`Affine` in the *free* sources only (a held source is folded into the
  constant), and written as

  - ``! <value>`` when it depends on no free source;
  - ``<name> <value>`` when it *is* one free source, unchanged (TOPAS
    Technical Reference § 2.1: "a parameter is flagged for refinement by giving
    it a name"; a name written in several places is one parameter, § 2.3's
    ``a lp 5.4031 / b lp 5.4031`` form, which is how an equality tie is spelt);
  - ``= <expression>;`` otherwise (§ 2.3: "equations can be a function of
    parameter names; this provides a mechanism for introducing linear …
    constraints"), with a ``prm <name> <value>`` declaration for any source no
    written quantity carries as itself.

  Names are derived from the rietx path (:meth:`RefinedSet.name`), so a reader
  can map them back. A source's finite bounds are written as ``min``/``max``
  on its first statement, because TOPAS's own default windows are not rietx's
  bounds (§ 2.10, Table 2-1).

**The scale.** rietx's scale multiplies M·|F|²·Lp per cell; TOPAS's multiplies
its own ``I_no_scale_pks`` and its ``LP_Factor``. For neutrons TOPAS's |F|² is
in barn, rietx's in fm², so a TOPAS intensity at the same scale is 0.01 × rietx's
(measured against TOPAS 6 output as a black box, no TOPAS code read:
``I_no_scale_pks`` = 0.01 × rietx M·|F|² for fifteen species and isotopes, to
2e-16, and ``tests/data/topas_export_nacl_neutron_ycalc.txt`` holds the constant
in a test). For X-rays ``LP_Factor(c)`` is, **by the Technical Reference's
definition and not yet held by an output in this tree**, rietx's
Lp = (K + (1 − K) cos² 2θ)/(sin² θ cos θ) divided by K, with cos² c = (1 − K)/K.
So TOPAS's scale is rietx's × 100 for neutrons and × K for X-rays
(:func:`topas_scale_factor`); the X-ray constant needs an oracle file like the
neutron one before it can be called measured.
