"""From a nuclear fit with unexplained intensity to a ranked list of magnetic structures.

``solve_magnetic`` is a **strategy**, not a new physics term: every step below
is a verb this package already has, and the module's job is the order they run
in, the criterion the answers are ranked by, and the sentence that comes out
when the powder cannot separate two of them.

The chain, and who owns each link:

1. **k** — the satellite arm of the unexplained-intensity report
   (:mod:`rietx.report.satellites`, WP-1326) sorts the positive residual peaks
   into the three places one can be.  Peaks on a reciprocal-lattice point the
   *nuclear* structure factor forbids are the **k = 0 signature** and are never
   scored against a candidate k: no nuclear model, right or wrong, puts
   intensity at a systematic absence, and a magnetic space group generally
   drops the parent's glides and screws, so that excess *is* the hypothesis.
   Only the peaks at neither a calculated line nor a forbidden lattice point
   need a propagation vector, and those are what the ranked candidate list is
   scored on.  Neither → the workflow abstains and says which.
2. **candidates** — :func:`rietx.crystallography.magnetic.isotropy.candidates`
   (M-7) enumerates, for each magnetic site, every order-parameter direction of
   every small irrep with a non-zero multiplicity, and gives each one as a
   magnetic space group in its own cell.
3. **one trial refinement per powder-equivalence class** — never one per
   candidate.  :func:`~rietx.crystallography.magnetic.isotropy.equivalence_classes`
   is Shirane's rule (1959) made mechanical: members of a class are models a
   powder pattern to this d limit cannot separate, so refining each of them
   would spend N fits to produce N copies of one number and then invite a
   reader to rank them.  The class is the unit; its members are *named* in the
   result and the powder's inability to separate them is the finding.
4. **ranking, and abstention** — see :data:`SOLVE_TIE_DELTA_BIC`.  Never Rwp:
   a candidate with more free amplitudes always reaches a lower Rwp, so an Rwp
   ordering is a freedom ordering wearing a fit's clothes.

**What the ranking is.**  ΔBIC first (:func:`rietx.report.layer2.delta_bic`,
Schwarz 1978 — the package's one BIC form), computed against a nuclear
reference refined *under the same stage list minus the moment paths*, so the
only difference between the two models is the moment block and ``n_added`` is
exactly the moment DOFs that stayed free.  BIC is where parsimony enters:
``−n_added·ln N`` charges every extra amplitude, which is why a nested triple
of groups reaching the same profile comes out in the order the smallest group
first.  Then the **magnetic-only R** (:attr:`MagneticTrial.r_magnetic`), a
profile R over exactly the channels the nuclear model puts nothing on — WP-1326's
buckets 2 and 3 — where 1.0 is "explains none of it" and 0 is "explains all of
it".  Then parsimony as a literal tiebreak, for the case where two classes have
the same amplitude count and the same χ².  A gap under
:data:`SOLVE_TIE_DELTA_BIC` is **not** a ranking: the classes inside it are
reported as tied and the verdict is an abstention naming all of them.

**The null test is a gate, not a column.**  A trial whose every moment comes
back unsupported (WP-1327 D4: below the floor *or* below
``MOMENT_SUPPORT_SIGMA`` of its own esd, because the null does not land at zero
— 0.0666 μ_B with an esd of 0.878 on a real 150 K pattern) cannot win, whatever
its ΔBIC.  When no trial has a supported moment the verdict is that there is
nothing to solve.  A powder-degenerate pair (Q5) is tested as the pair: each
modulus alone rides a flat direction and fails the ratio however large it is,
so the gate reads the quadrature sum the powder does measure
(:attr:`MomentRow.pair_supported`).

**What it refuses.**  An X-ray histogram, by name: the *position* of a magnetic
satellite and of a superstructure reflection are the same and the inference is
not, and a moment refined against X-rays has no gradient anywhere
(:func:`rietx.model.forward.magnetic_wanted`).  A histogram whose report shows
no unexplained intensity is not refused — it is answered, with the reason.

**Provisional.**  The chain is stable; the ranking criterion is not.  M-10
(mode amplitudes) changes what a trial refines, M-11 (incommensurate k) adds a
branch this module abstains on today, and WP-1329's temperature series is a
discriminator none of the numbers here can be.  See the compatibility chapter.

#: ΔBIC below which two classes are **tied** and the workflow abstains rather
#: than ranking them.  6.0 is "strong" on the Kass & Raftery (1995) scale and
#: is the same bar ``PEAK_KEEP_COMPONENT_MIN_DELTA_BIC`` uses one subsystem
#: over: a determination that names a winner on weaker evidence than that is
#: the confident wrong singleton the indexing rule (WP-1043) exists to stop.
#: It is the *width of the tie*, quoted in the result, never a threshold a
#: caller is invited to tune down until an answer appears.
SOLVE_TIE_DELTA_BIC = 6.0

#: Relative separation in the magnetic-only R below which two ΔBIC-tied classes
#: are still tied.  A profile R over a few hundred channels of a weak magnetic
#: signal is not a three-figure quantity, and 2 % is about where two fits of
#: the same data by the same code stop being the same number.
SOLVE_TIE_R_MAGNETIC = 0.02

#: How many candidate propagation vectors the ranked list is carried down to
#: when the excess indexes as satellites.  A list, never a singleton: the top
#: row is a hypothesis worth testing.
SOLVE_TOP_K = 3

#: How many of the ranked candidate k's (already capped by ``top_k``) get a
#: full trial refinement of their own, not merely a fallback tried when an
#: earlier one's classes all refuse to be stated as a model.  1 is the
#: pre-Q4 behaviour — only the first testable k is ever fitted.  2 (the
#: default) also fits the runner-up when it is within
#: :data:`SOLVE_K_OFFSET_MARGIN_DEG` of the winner's satellite fit, because a
#: satellite match alone cannot separate two k's that index the same peaks
#: equally well — measured on Ba2FeSbSe5, where k=(1/2,0,1/2) and
#: k=(1/2,1/2,0) both index the same 11 peaks (worst offsets 0.100 deg and
#: 0.181 deg) and only the moment refinement's intensity can tell them apart.
SOLVE_K_TRIALS = 2

#: Named offset margin deciding which runner-up k's are "close enough" on the
#: satellite step alone to be worth a second full trial refinement (Q4).  Two
#: candidates that index the same number of satellites (``matched``) and
#: whose worst offset differs by no more than this are not separated by the
#: satellite step; Ba2FeSbSe5's pair above are 0.081 deg apart, comfortably
#: inside it.
SOLVE_K_OFFSET_MARGIN_DEG = 0.5

#: ΔBIC gap below which the top two *k-vector* trials (not two candidate
#: classes of the *same* k, which is :data:`SOLVE_TIE_DELTA_BIC`) are not
#: separated by intensity either, and ``K_VECTOR_UNSEPARATED`` is reported.
#: Wider than the intra-k tie width on purpose: two different propagation
#: vectors are two different models of the data, not two descriptions of one
#: model the way a class's members are, so the bar for calling them
#: indistinguishable is a coarser one.
SOLVE_K_TIE_DELTA_BIC = 10.0

#: d limit, in Å, for M-7's powder-equivalence test.  The classes are a
#: statement about *a powder pattern to a d limit*, so the limit is a
#: parameter of the answer and is quoted in the result.
SOLVE_D_MIN = 1.5

#: Seed modulus, μ_B, for a trial refinement's moment.  A seed, not a claim:
#: WP-1327 measured that four in-plane seeds on Cr₂WO₆ reach the same answer,
#: and the direction of the seed is always **inside the candidate's own allowed
#: subspace** (:func:`~rietx.crystallography.magnetic.moments.tilted_seed`,
#: mostly along the allowed basis's first row and, since WP-1418 stage (b),
#: with a small nonzero component on every other row too when the basis has
#: more than one — see :data:`~rietx.crystallography.magnetic.moments.
#: SEED_TILT`), which is the one thing a seed here must not get wrong.
SOLVE_SEED_MU_B = 2.0

#: Alias of :data:`~rietx.crystallography.magnetic.moments.SEED_TILT`, kept

#: see that constant's docstring for the mechanism and :func:`_seed`.
SOLVE_SEED_TILT = _moments.SEED_TILT

#: The stage list a trial refines under on a **constant-wavelength** histogram,
#: unless a caller supplies a plan.  Moment + scale + background first — the
#: block that has to climb out of the noise before anything else is allowed to
#: move — then the fuller stage.
#:
#: **Coordinates are deliberately absent.**  Freeing them lets each candidate's
#: *nuclear* model absorb a different amount of the magnetic intensity, which
#: is precisely the confound a ranking must not have; and for a supercell
#: statement the child asymmetric unit is larger than the parent's, so its
#: coordinates are the parameters T-6 measured as the unstable ones.

#: Fraction of a site's own seed that an *absent* moment is restored at when a
#: one-site start releases the rest.  Small enough that the released amplitudes
#: start near the submodel the leg converged to, non-zero because |F_m|² ∝ m²
#: makes an exactly-zero moment a dead column (WP-1327).  The value is the one
#: the Ba₆Co₆ measurement used.
SOLVE_RELEASE_FRACTION = 0.05

#: Relative Rwp separation above which two starts of one candidate are counted
#: as **different minima** rather than the same one reached twice.
SOLVE_MINIMUM_RTOL = 1e-4

#: WP-1343.  **The turn-on order for a magnetic width, as a stage list.**
#: Three steps, and the order is forced: a magnetic broadening term and the
#: moment it belongs to both lower the calculated magnetic peak's *height* —
#: the moment because p²|F_⊥|² goes as m², the width because it spreads the
#: same integrated area over more channels — so freed together from a cold
#: start they trade against each other and the fit converges on whichever pair
#: the first step happened to like.  It is the same degeneracy the package
#: already stages around for nuclear size/strain against scale, and the
#: discipline ``mccusker_structural`` encodes one subject over.
#:
#: 1. the moment, with both widths held at zero (their default, which *is* the
#:    off state — the second frozen family is not even built, so the widths
#:    are not merely fixed but structurally absent from the draw);
#: 2. the widths, with the moment held at the value step 1 reached;
#: 3. both together, from a start where each is already near its own answer.
#:
#: Deliberately **not** folded into :data:`SOLVE_STAGE_PATHS`: that list is
#: what ``solve_magnetic`` ranks candidates under, and a ranking whose stages
#: also fit a width would let each candidate absorb a different amount of the
#: magnetic intensity into its own profile — the confound M-9 removed
#: coordinates for.  A width is fitted *after* a structure is chosen.
#: The value a freed magnetic width is lifted to before the stage solves, in
#: deg 2θ.  **Not a claim about the specimen — a claim about softplus.**  Both
#: terms are softplus-bounded at zero, and the map's slope at p = 0 is zero,
#: so a coefficient starting at its exact default has a dead column and TRF
#: never moves it: measured on the synthetic k ≠ 0 round trip below, the term
#: freed from 0.0 came back at 1e-12 with the moment still 14 % low and the
#: whole broadening unmodelled, while the same fit seeded here recovers both.
#: It is ``Stage.seed``'s existing job — the extinction stage seeds 1e-3 and
#: the roughness stage 0.3 for the same reason — and 0.05 deg is about a
#: 200 nm magnetic domain at a cold-neutron wavelength, i.e. inside the range
#: the term is for and below :data:`~rietx.model.forward.MAGNETIC_SIZING_FLOOR`,
#: which is what the windows were sized for.
MAGNETIC_WIDTH_SEED_DEG = 0.05

#: **Both** width terms, and which of the two carries the effect is a property
#: of the dataset rather than of the physics, so the plan cannot choose.
#: Measured, three datasets, same code path:
#:
#: * synthetic k ≠ 0 supercell with a planted 1/cosθ broadening — the *size*
#:   term takes it (0.2451 ± 0.0083 against a planted 0.25) and the strain
#:   term is dead (0.0015 ± 0.0531);
#: * Cr₂WO₆ 4 K (k = 0, but with magnetic-only intensity on the parent's
#:   absences) — size 0.1006 ± 0.0353, strain 0.0104 ± 0.1000;
#: * Ba₂FeSbSe₅ 1.5 K (k = (½,0,½), the axial-divergence protocol) — the
#:   **strain** term takes it (0.375 ± 0.283) and the size term goes to zero
#:   with no esd at all.
#:
#: A size-only step would therefore have been blind to the one real k ≠ 0
#: dataset in the corpus. Freeing both costs two things and both are reported
#: rather than hidden: the live term's esd inflates ≈ 2× (0.0083 → 0.0163 on
#: the synthetic) because the two widths are collinear over one pattern's θ
#: range, and the **last stage comes back ``max_iter``** when one of them is
#: dead, because a flat direction is what TRF walks until it runs out. The
#: answer does not move — size 0.2451 → 0.2449, Rwp 0.08131 → 0.08130, both
#: moments inside 0.002 μ_B — and ``MAGNETIC_WIDTH_UNMEASURED`` names the dead
#: term, so the status has its explanation in the same result.
#:
#: *Rejected: ``ftol = 1e-7`` on the answer-producing stage.* Measured, it
#: converges in 269 iterations and changes no number (size 0.2448, Rwp
#: 0.08130) — so it buys the label ``converged`` and nothing else on *this*
#: dataset. On one where both widths are live it would genuinely stop earlier
#: than 1e-9 and move the last digits of every answer this preset produces,
#: and the last stage's tolerance is the one this package says is not
#: loosened. The honest output is ``max_iter`` beside the code that explains
#: it.

    """Determine a magnetic structure from a converged nuclear fit, or abstain.

    ``refinement`` is a :class:`rietx.Refinement` that has **already fitted**
    ``data`` with a nuclear model; its fitted structure and instrument are the
    starting point, so the nuclear reference below starts converged rather than
    being re-derived.

    ``sites`` (labels) or ``species`` name the sites that carry a moment; with
    neither, every site whose species is a magnetic form-factor key is taken.
    ``ion`` is that key — ``"Mn3+"``, or a mapping from label or species to one
    — and is **not** ``Atom.species``.  Where a site's ion is not stated by the
    caller here, the same fallback :func:`~rietx.crystallography.cif.
    structure_from_cif` applies at read is applied to the candidate builder
    too (WP-1327; stage3 D1): a bare element with no neutral-atom ``<j0>``
    resolves through :func:`~.crystallography.magnetic.form_factor.
    resolve_assumed_ion` to its majority magnetic oxidation state, reported as
    ``MAGNETIC_ION_ASSUMED`` on :attr:`MagneticSolution.diagnostics`.

    ``g`` is the Landé factor that ion needs — one float for every magnetic
    site, or a mapping from label or species to one, mirroring ``ion``.
    ``None`` (the default) is the spin-only 2 for a 3d/4d ion and is
    **refused** for a 4f/5f one (:func:`~.crystallography.magnetic.
    form_factor.needs_explicit_g`) *unless* that ion was itself not stated by
    the caller (came from the table directly, or from the
    ``resolve_assumed_ion`` fallback above) — there its free-ion Hund's-rule
    g_J (:func:`~.crystallography.magnetic.form_factor.assumed_lande_g`) is
    used instead of leaving every 4f/5f candidate to abstain with no route
    around it, reported as ``LANDE_G_ASSUMED``.  A caller-stated ``ion`` or
    ``g`` always wins over both defaults (issue #257 A5's rule, carried over
    from the CIF reader), and neither default ever changes a non-4f/5f site's
    behaviour.

    ``k`` skips the propagation-vector step and states the vector: useful when
    a k is known from a single crystal.  Otherwise the arm decides, and the
    result records which of its three routes it took.

    ``plan`` overrides :data:`SOLVE_STAGE_PATHS` for both the trials and the
    nuclear reference; pass one whose stages differ only by the moment paths,
    or ΔBIC stops meaning what it says.

    ``cif_dir`` writes one magCIF per refined class (:meth:`
    MagneticSolution.write_magcifs`).  Nothing is written without it.

    ``k_trials`` (Q4) is how many of the ranked candidate k's get their own
    full trial refinement rather than being carried only as a fallback for
    when an earlier k's classes all refuse — see :data:`SOLVE_K_TRIALS` and
    :data:`SOLVE_K_OFFSET_MARGIN_DEG`.  ``k_tie_width`` is the ΔBIC gap below
    which the top two such k's are reported as not separated by intensity
    either (``K_VECTOR_UNSEPARATED``, in :attr:`MagneticSolution.diagnostics`)
    — see :data:`SOLVE_K_TIE_DELTA_BIC`.  Every k actually tried is reported
    in :attr:`MagneticSolution.k_trials`, whether it won or not.

    Refuses by name on a non-neutron histogram.  Everything else — no
    unexplained intensity, no candidate k, a tie at the top — is *reported*,
    which is the 1043/1301 rule this workflow inherits: a determination stage
    returns a ranked list with a stated criterion and an abstention reason,
    never a confident wrong singleton.
