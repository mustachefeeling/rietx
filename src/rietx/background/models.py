    λ on its own carries units of inverse intensity squared: multiply y and σ
    by k and the data rows do not move while the penalty's effective weight
    moves by k² (WP-1454 measured an 8-knot background go from unpenalised to
    a straight line on a unit change alone).  Dividing the rows by σ̄, the
    median σ over the fitted channels, removes the units.  Multiplying them by
    √m, with m the fitted channels per coefficient, removes the sampling

    λ·(h/W)⁴ of the fit it buys, with h the knot spacing, so λ = 1 suppresses
    features narrower than about one knot spacing and leaves wider ones to the

    at stage compile, like σ itself.  m counts every coefficient, so it holds
    as stated only while the knots span the fitted channels, which
