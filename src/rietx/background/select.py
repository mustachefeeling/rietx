"""Automatic background-complexity selection.

Two knobs need choosing before a refinement: the Chebyshev order (or
P-spline stiffness λ) of the co-refined background, and the arPLS λ of a
fixed estimated baseline.  Both use the same two ingredients:

* **BIC on peak-masked channels** — background flexibility must be justified
  by the *background* channels only, so Bragg-peak channels (net > 3σ above
  a robust baseline) are masked out of the score:
  BIC = m·ln(RSS/m) + k·ln(m)  (Schwarz, 1978, Ann. Stat. 6, 461).
* **Durbin-Watson whiteness stopping** — d = Σ(Δᵢ−Δᵢ₋₁)²/ΣΔᵢ² on the masked
  residuals (Durbin & Watson, 1950; Hill & Flack, 1987, J. Appl. Cryst. 20,
  356).  d rises toward 2 as the background stops leaving serially-correlated
  structure; once d ≥ ``dw_stop`` extra flexibility only chases noise, so the
  scan stops (masked channels are treated as contiguous for d — the gaps at
  peak positions make the test slightly conservative, which is the safe
  direction).

The selected order is the BIC minimiser among the scanned candidates.  A scan
that returns its own cap without the whiteness stop has not chosen an order,
and says so: ``BACKGROUND_ORDER_AT_CAP`` (issue #833).

A declared fixed curve (a measured blank, an estimated baseline) is passed to
:func:`select_chebyshev_order` as ``fixed``, because the order worth choosing is
the order of the *remainder*.  :func:`select_arpls_lambda` takes no such
argument on purpose: it chooses how stiffly to **estimate** a baseline, which is
the question somebody with a measured one has already answered.

    ``fixed`` is a declared measured or estimated curve the polynomial sits on
    top of, and it changes the question: the order being chosen is the order of
    what the curve does **not** describe.  Without it the scan measures the
    curve's own shape as though the polynomial had to reproduce it, and picks
    the flexibility to do so — which is the opposite of why anybody measured a
    blank (WP-1309, issue #171 note 4).

    How it enters follows the fit rather than approximating it.  A **held**
    scale is a known additive curve, so it comes off the data and costs no
    parameter.  A **free** scale is one more direction, so it joins the design
    and counts in the BIC's k — leaving it out of k would credit the fit with a
    degree of freedom it spent, and the two are not the same scan.

    **Read the scan within one setting of ``fixed``, never across two.**  A held
    scale changes the response variable, so its RSS carries the curve's own
    counting noise and its BIC cannot be compared with a scan that kept y whole.
    What is comparable is the *order*, and the order is the point: measured on
    the synthetic fixture of ``tests/test_background_measured.py``, a blind scan
    runs to 12 terms chasing a halo, while the same pattern with the curve held
    at its true scale selects **2** and gets worse with every term after.

    A free scale with a high ``max_order`` is the case to be careful with, and
    the care is a low ``max_order`` rather than a guard.  The polynomial and the
    curve are not orthogonal, so given enough terms the scan will dial the
    measured curve away and describe the same shape itself — BIC prefers it, and
    the scale that comes back is then a number about the polynomial.

    **A selection equal to ``max_order`` without the whiteness stop is the cap,
    not a choice**, and ``diagnostics`` carries ``BACKGROUND_ORDER_AT_CAP``
    naming the cap and the last d.  BIC was still falling at the last order
    scanned and d never reached ``dw_stop``.  On the 11-BM Si 640c pattern
    (8-30°, 20 542 masked channels) that is the default's outcome, and at
    ``max_order=32`` the scan returns 32: each term gains 50-800 in BIC against a
    penalty ln m ≈ 10, and d stays at 0.43-1.02, because the masked residual's
    serial correlation comes from profile misfit that no polynomial removes
    (issue #833).  An interior BIC minimum and a scan the stop ended carry no
    code.
