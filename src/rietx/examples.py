"""Example projects, shipped in the wheel (WP-1204).

A new user's first problem is not the refinement; it is having nothing to
refine.  So the GUI's empty state offers a short list of real specimens, each
one click from an open project, and this module is what stands behind that
click: a data directory inside the package, and a build that is a plain
:meth:`Project.create` with the standard's own protocol.

**The protocol is quoted, never restated.**  Each example *is* an entry in
:data:`rietx.viz.compare.STANDARDS` — the same registry the settings-comparison
UI ranks corrections on, pinned field by field against the acceptance suites by
``tests/test_compare_ui.py``.  So an example's plan, held parameters and
excluded regions are the ones the suite measures, and there is no second copy
to drift.  What this module adds is a sentence for a person who has not
refined anything yet, which is a different reader from the one comparing
corrections.

**The list is derived from what shipped.**  :func:`list_examples` is
``STANDARDS`` filtered by :meth:`Standard.available` against
:func:`examples_dir`, so adding a file to the package data adds an example and
removing one removes it — there is no hand-written list to fall out of step
with the directory.  Which standards ship is a *licensing* question and not a
size one: the IUCr CPD round-robin patterns carry no explicit licence (see
``tests/data/README.md``) and are already kept out of the sdist, so the four
pure-phase standards built on them cannot ship here either.  Everything below
is APS, NIST or COD material.

**Nothing here fits anything.**  A build writes a project at its starting
values; the refinement is the user's first click, not ours.

**A file a guide needs but no example uses is fetched, not shipped**
(:func:`fetch`, WP-1986).  The 11-BM silicon scan and its empty capillary are
3 MB the wheel would carry for two manual pages, so each is downloaded on
first use from the repository at a pinned commit and checked against its
sha256.  The test suite fills the cache from ``tests/data/`` and never reaches
the network.

#: acceptance suite, but it is not an example: NIST step-scanned only the 24
#: windows containing peaks, so 39 % of its 20.3-150.9° span is measured and
#: the rest is not there at all.  That is normal for a certification
#: measurement and reads as broken data to someone meeting the package for the
#: first time.  An example is what a stranger opens with no provenance to go
#: on, so the bar is higher than "a good dataset".
