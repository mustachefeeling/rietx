"""The one "did you mean" in the package: a missing name answered with the closest real one.

Four surfaces answer a name that does not exist with the name that does: a
top-level attribute (``rietx.__getattr__``), a schema field
(``schemas.common.Base.__getattr__``), a ``Stage``/``RefinementPlan`` field
(``strategy.staged``), and a stage ``turn_on`` path that names no parameter
(``STAGE_PATH_UNKNOWN``, WP-1414).  They share this module so that "closest"
means one thing everywhere, and a change to it is one edit.

Standard-library only and importing nothing from the package, because
``rietx/__init__.py`` reaches it before anything else is built.

**Case is folded before the ratio.**  ``difflib`` is case-sensitive, so on a
dot path it answered ``instrument.profile.U`` — Caglioti's U as every paper
writes it — with ``instrument.profile.y``, a real path one character away and
the wrong parameter.  An exact match up to case is therefore offered first; the
``difflib`` ranking (cutoff 0.6, the value all three older call sites used)
fills the rest.
