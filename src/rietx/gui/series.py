"""The GUI's sequential-series surface — the setup, and the answer (WP-1016).

A series is N *separate* refinements chained by a warm start
(:mod:`rietx.sequential`), not one joint residual, and this module is where
that shape meets a session that owns exactly one project.  Three decisions carry
it, and each is a refusal to grow something.

**A series lives beside the project, not inside it.**  ``ProjectDoc.patterns``
stays length 1 and ``Project.open`` still refuses more, so the series' patterns
are staged uploads (WP-1014) held in the session, its per-pattern histories are
**in memory**, and its answer is session-scoped like ``Refinement.result_``.
That is not a shortcut: an upload token dies with the session
(``UploadStore.close``), so a *persisted* series would need a document to name
its files, which is exactly the schema growth the v1.0 GUI plan told this WP to
record for WP-1003 rather than perform.  What the project *does* supply is the
protocol — mode, plan, 2θ limits and excluded regions all come from
``project.json``, so one protocol is applied to N specimens and the series cannot
disagree with the single-pattern fit beside it about what is being fitted.

**The models come from the working state, and the settings from here.**  The
starting structure and instrument are the project's head — a series warm-starts
from whatever the user has already got right — while ``carry``/``refit``/
``direction``/``x_label`` are properties of the chain and have nowhere else to
live.  ``carry`` is a *control*, not a tuning knob (WP-0505 measured that
carrying everything costs 838 iterations against 904 for a narrower glob, with
identical Rwp), and :data:`CARRY_HELP` is that sentence where the editor can
show it.

**The disagreement between the two chains is reported as a number here, not as a
field on a diagnostic.**  ``SEQUENTIAL_PATH_DEPENDENT`` is a
:class:`~rietx.schemas.common.Diagnostic`, which carries ``where`` and no
magnitude — the wall WP-1012 hit displaying guard diagnostics per node, and left
to WP-1003 as a freeze question.  It does not need answering: the two chains'
trajectories are both in hand, so :func:`trajectories` recomputes the combined-σ
distance the same way :func:`sequential._path_dependence_diagnostics` does and
serves it per path.  A panel can then rank by disagreement without a schema
change.
