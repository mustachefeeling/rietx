"""Read-side repairs for documents written by an earlier release.

Two repairs, each one authority with its own list of the places it is
applied: a renamed dot-path, repaired on the document *text*
(:func:`migrate_document_text`, :data:`READ_POINTS`), and a declared range a
release dropped from a caller's own ``Parameter``, repaired on the parsed
models (:func:`restore_declared_ranges`, :data:`DECLARED_RANGE_READ_POINTS`).

**The rename is textual on purpose.**  A dot-path is not confined to
one schema field: it is a value in a history node's ``free_paths``, a glob in a
saved plan's ``turn_on``, a key in a tie table, a row label in an ``.rxt``.
Enumerating the fields that may hold one is how a migration misses the fifth
place, so the repair is applied to the document *text* at the three points a
stored document is read, and each is named in :data:`READ_POINTS`.

**Why the paths matter more than the field.**  The two halves of the v1.2
``background_peaks`` rename fail differently.  A stored *value* under a name the
schema no longer has fails loudly, under ``extra="forbid"``, naming the field.
A stored *glob* under the old name loads clean and then matches nothing: the
stage runs, frees nothing, and the fit returns a plausible answer with a
declared hump silently unrefined.  This module exists for the second case.
:meth:`rietx.schemas.instrument.Instrument._migrate_v1_2_background_peaks`
handles the first.

#: **Two readers are outside it on purpose**, and both are named here rather
#: than left to be rediscovered:
#:
#: * :func:`rietx.history.events.read_events` — a v1.2 ``live/events.jsonl``
#:   replayed through ``rietx watch`` shows dot-paths in the old spelling.
#:   Nothing raises (an event's ``data`` is an open dict) and the effect is
#:   display-only, on a run that has already finished, so the cost of a
#:   fourth repair point is not paid for.
#: * :class:`rietx.schemas.results.RefinementResult` — its renamed *count*
#:   field is repaired at the schema instead, because ``n_background_peaks``
#:   offers no word boundary before the legacy name for the rule below to
#:   catch, and a result JSON is read by ``rietx html`` rather than by any
#:   reader here.

#: The legacy name as a whole word: not followed by a letter, digit or
#: underscore, so ``background_peaksish`` is left alone while every spelling
#: that actually occurs is caught.
#:
#: **One rule, matching the bare name rather than a prefixed path**, because the
#: name reaches a stored document in four shapes and anchoring on any one of
#: them misses the others:
#:
#: * ``"background_peaks":`` — the JSON key, in a project or a history node;
#: * ``instrument.background_peaks.0.fwhm`` — a dot-path in ``free_paths``;
#: * ``background_peaks.0.fwhm`` — the same row in an ``.rxt``, which renders
#:   each block with its own prefix stripped (``textdoc._render_block``), so the
#:   ``instrument.`` is simply not there;
#: * ``instrument.background_peaks*`` — a glob a caller wrote without the dot,
#:   which fnmatch accepts and a dot-anchored rule would skip.
#:
#: An earlier version of this module anchored on ``instrument.`` and silently
#: missed the third, which is the same class of gap the module exists to close,
#: reintroduced inside it.
#:
#: **What being textual costs, stated rather than discovered.**  The rule cannot
#: see structure, so it also rewrites the legacy word where it is not a path: a
#: ``HumpComponent.label``, a history annotation note, or — the only one with
#: teeth — a ``DataRef`` pointing at a pattern file a user happened to name
#: ``background_peaks.xye``, whose stored path would be rewritten and then not
#: found.  Accepted rather than repaired: making the rule structure-aware means
#: enumerating the fields that may hold a path, which is the failure this module
#: exists to avoid, and the residue **fails loudly** (a missing file, named) in
#: the one case that bites, rather than silently the way a stale glob does.

    **The defect** (issue #204, the read half #209): until a class inherited
    (:class:`~rietx.schemas.common._InheritsDeclaredDefaults`, from its
    ``_declared_since``), a caller's ``Parameter(value=..., vary=...)`` for a
    field that declares a range got ``(-inf, inf)``, no unit and ``identity``,
    and ``model_dump`` wrote those out explicitly.  So such a document reloads
    with every key present, inherits nothing at construction, and refines
    unbounded again.  Fixed at construction for ``Atom`` by PR #206, for every
    other class by WP-1321; this is what reaches the documents already written.

    **The signature is a bare attribute in a document older than its class's
    inheritance**, per attribute and by :func:`declared_fills` — the same rule
    construction applies, with absence read as "holds the bare value" because
    serialization left no other trace.  Before ``_declared_since`` an explicit
    bare attribute and an omission were the same thing, so reading one as the
    other loses nothing a caller could have meant; from it on, an explicit
    ``min=-inf`` is a choice, and a document written then is left alone.  A
    bound that is merely *wider* than the declared one is never touched:
    WP-1311 made ``max=60`` on a hot specimen's ``biso`` the documented escape.

    **In the reader, with a diagnostic, never in a schema validator** (root
    CLAUDE.md: a silent correction is a reader's to make, because only the read
    path has a channel to say it did).  ``PreferredOrientation``'s silent
    floor repair is not the precedent: its licence is a pole feeding the solver
    NaNs, which a merely loose bound is not.

    One record per parameter the restore would change: its dot-path (under
    ``prefix``), the atom label where there is one, the ``Parameter`` itself,
    the attributes to fill, the stored and the restored attributes, and the
    class's ``_declared_since``.  :func:`restore_declared_ranges` decides which
    to apply.
