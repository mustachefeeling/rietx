"""Schemas for the project container — what a saved session *is* on disk.

Two rules shape these models, and both are about avoiding a second authority:

**The model state is not here.**  ``project.json`` carries the data reference
and the settings; the parameter values, the vary flags and the free set live in
``history.jsonl``, whose head is the working state.  Every verb that changes
them (``set_vary``, ``set_values``, ``edit``, a stage) already commits a node, so
a copy in this document could only ever be a second opinion about the same
numbers — and WP-1004 spent its session on what happens when a stage's arguments
exist in three places and one of them silently loses a field.  The consequence
is worth stating plainly: **saving is about settings, not about durability.**  A
refinement is on disk the moment its node is appended, whether or not anyone
called ``Project.save``.

**What is here is what nothing else owns.**  A pattern file does not record the
regions a user excluded, the plan they selected, or their panel layout; a history
node does not record them either (see ``ProjectDoc.excluded_regions``).  Those
are the fields below.
