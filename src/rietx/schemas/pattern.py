"""Measured powder pattern container.

**One pattern, one abscissa, and the abscissa says which one it is.**  A
constant-wavelength measurement puts an angle on the x axis; a time-of-flight
neutron measurement (ISIS, SNS, LANSCE) puts a flight time in microseconds
there, and the two are not convertible without a per-bank calibration the
pattern does not carry.  So :class:`PatternData` holds ``two_theta`` **or**
``tof`` and never both, and every consumer asks which it has rather than
