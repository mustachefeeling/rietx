"""``Refinement.profile_fraction()`` result schemas and gates (WP-1320).

A weight fraction's esd is the curvature of χ² where the fit stopped, so it
describes one basin.  A trace phase's scale trades against its width until its
peaks are background, and that ridge can hold several basins at one χ² (issue
#203: 1.41 ± 0.65 wt% on a pattern admitting 0 %, ~1.5 % and 98.7 % within
0.011 pp of Rwp).  The profile pins the phase's width on a grid, refits the
rest, and reports every fraction the data admits: a *range*, beside the answer
rather than inside it, with the grid carried so the range can be checked.

Constants live beside the models they gate, as in ``schemas/suggest.py``, so the
serialized profile explains its own gate.

#: every reported esd already carries, so on a single quadratic basin the
