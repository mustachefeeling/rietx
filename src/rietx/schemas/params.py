"""The parameter table as data: one row per refinable scalar.

``params.vector.Entry`` is the ground truth of what a parameter *is* — path,
value, vary flag, bounds, transform, affine tie, locked flag — but it is a
dataclass inside the optimiser's translation layer, and the hot loop is
deliberately free of pydantic.  :class:`ParameterRow` is its serializable twin
for the cold paths: a listing for a caller (``Refinement.parameters()``), a GUI
parameter table (WP-1011), a text document (WP-1009).

Unlike :class:`~rietx.schemas.results.RefinedParameter`, which reports what a
fit *refined*, a row exists for **every** entry — fixed, locked and tied ones
included.  A caller deciding what to free next has to see the whole table,
including the parts it may not touch and why it may not.  Five separate
reasons make a row un-refinable and they are distinguishable on purpose:

* ``locked`` — structurally fixed, ``set_vary`` can never free it (a
  symmetry-fixed cell angle, the line-0 emission weight, ``biso`` on a site
  that declares an anisotropic tensor);
* ``tie`` — an affine function of other entries, so the freedom lives in its
  sources (``b`` in a tetragonal cell, an atom coordinate behind its Wyckoff
  DOFs);
* ``mode_fixed`` — refinable in principle, but force-fixed by the intensity
  mode currently in force;
* ``held`` — the caller declared it does not move, with ``Refinement.hold``
  (WP-1435).  The only one a caller both created and can lift;
* ``needs_held_cell`` — a wavelength this histogram's free cell makes
  degenerate.  The only *dynamic* one: another parameter's state decides it.

:attr:`ParameterRow.refinable` is the single predicate over the five, so a
front end has one rule to grey a row by rather than five it could get wrong.
:attr:`ParameterRow.held_because` orders them by what the caller can do.

    group and the Wyckoff position every time it is constructed, and nothing a

        ``Entry`` is what the residual reads; an esd is a property of a
        *completed* fit, and merging it here is what lets one listing answer
        "what is this worth, and how well is it known".
    ``mode_fixed``

        frees it again.  The distinction matters most for a Le Bail-only phase,
