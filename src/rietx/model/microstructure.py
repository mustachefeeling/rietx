"""A phase's profile coefficients read as a coherent domain size and a Δd/d.

WP-1131's reporting half, and the peer of :mod:`rietx.model.geometry`: that one
turns refined coordinates into bond lengths with esds, this one turns refined
widths into a length and a dimensionless strain with esds.  Both are
**evidence, never a verdict** — nothing here says a domain size is reasonable.

Three rules, all of them borrowed rather than invented:

* **The conversions live in one place and it is not here.**
  :mod:`rietx.model.profiles.caglioti` owns Scherrer and the tanθ law in both
  directions; this module calls them and states no constant of its own.
* **A quantity that cannot be measured is absent, not zero** (WP-1072).  A
  coefficient at its off state, a source with no wavelength and a column that
  measured nothing are three different absences and each names itself in
  ``MicrostructureTerm.unavailable``.
* **The propagation is exact and single-parameter.**  Each reading is a
  function of one coefficient — ``L = (180/π)·K·λ/x`` and
  ``Δd/d = (π/360)·y`` — so J·Cov·Jᵀ is one variance and there is no
  cross-term to drop.  That is *why* the Gaussian and Lorentzian readings are
  reported separately and compared rather than combined into one number: a
  combined size is a function of two correlated columns, and this module would
  then be quoting a covariance it is not given.

**What the size is a size of.**  The phase's *own* coefficient, not
``instrument.profile.x + phases.N.lor_size``: under the instrument ⊕ sample
split the instrument terms are calibrated on a standard and frozen, so the
sample term is the specimen's whole contribution and reading it alone is the
point of the split.  A fit that never calibrated the instrument has put
instrument width into the sample term, and the size that comes back is a lower
bound — which is Scherrer's usual caveat, not a new one.
