"""Angular dependence of profile widths — instrument ⊕ sample split.

Gaussian *variance* (variances add under convolution):

    Γ_G²(θ) = (U + Us)·tan²θ + V·tanθ + W + P/cos²θ     [deg² 2θ]

U, V, W are the instrument resolution function (Caglioti, Paoletti & Ricci,
1958, Nucl. Instrum. 3, 223); the sample adds a Gaussian microstrain term
Us·tan²θ and a Gaussian size term P/cos²θ (the GSAS ``P``; Larson & Von
Dreele, 2004, GSAS manual; Thompson, Cox & Hastings, 1987, J. Appl. Cryst.
20, 79).

Lorentzian FWHM (Lorentzian convolution adds FWHMs):

    Γ_L(θ) = (X + Xs)/cosθ + (Y + Ys)·tanθ              [deg 2θ]

The 1/cosθ (and 1/cos²θ variance) terms carry Scherrer crystallite-size
broadening and the tanθ (tan²θ) terms microstrain broadening.  Note the
letter conventions differ between codes (GSAS: X=size, Y=strain; FullProf
swaps them) — this module documents the *physics* via argument names.

Reading a width as a size
-------------------------
The width laws above are in deg 2θ, which is the unit the pattern arrives in
and the wrong unit to *judge* a width in: the same 1.0 deg FWHM is a 8.2 nm
crystallite on Cu Kα and a 2.2 nm one on 11-BM's 0.4139 Å (computed below,
pinned in ``tests/test_profile_size.py``).  A number of degrees is therefore
not transferable between instruments, while the crystallite size it implies is
— which is the same statement as working in Q, since Scherrer broadening is
*constant* in Q:

    Q = 4π·sinθ/λ,  so  dQ/d(2θ) = 2π·cosθ/λ,  and with
    β(2θ) = K·λ/(L·cosθ)                                     [Scherrer, rad]
    ΔQ = (2π·cosθ/λ)·β = 2π·K/L                               [Å⁻¹]     (3)

independent of both λ and θ.  Hence :func:`apparent_size`, and the exact
consequence that makes it cheap: because the size law *is* 1/cosθ, the cosθ of
(3) cancels the cosθ of the law and a size **coefficient** maps to one size
with no reference angle at all —

    L = (180/π)·K·λ / x_size                                             (4)

for the Lorentzian ``x_size``, and the same with √``gauss_size`` for the
Gaussian variance coefficient.  :func:`apparent_size_from_size_coefficient` is
(4) and :func:`size_coefficient_for_size` is its inverse, which is what seeds a
width from a known specimen.

Reading a width as a strain
---------------------------
The strain law inverts the same way and needs *less*: microstrain broadens by a
fixed fraction of every d-spacing, Δ2θ = 2·(Δd/d)·tanθ in radians, so

    Δd/d = (π/180)·y_strain / 2                                            (5)

with **no wavelength and no shape constant** — :func:`microstrain_from_strain_coefficient`
and its inverse :func:`strain_coefficient_for_microstrain`.  That asymmetry is
the whole content of WP-1131: two of the six sample-broadening quantities depend
on λ and they are exactly the two named "size", so one specimen measured at two
wavelengths shares a strain coefficient and does **not** share a size one.

**Which parameters this reaches**, since it is the point of reading a width as
a size at all: exactly the two size coefficients of the laws above, and no
others.  ``x_size`` is ``instrument.profile.x + phases.N.lor_size``,
``gauss_size`` is ``phases.N.gauss_size``, and their declared bounds are where
the deg-versus-Å question bites:

* ``instrument.profile.x`` carries ``max = 1.0`` deg — 79.4 Å on Cu Kα against
  21.3 Å on 11-BM.  One cap, a 3.7× spread in the physics it admits.
* ``Phase.lor_size`` and ``Phase.gauss_size`` carry ``min = 0.0`` and **no max
  at all**, so on the sample side an unbounded specimen width is not capped
  badly — it is not capped.

The Caglioti ``u`` and ``w`` are **not** size terms and have no size to read:
``w`` is constant in θ and ``u`` goes as tan²θ, neither of them 1/cosθ.  A
number of degrees taken off either is a number at one chosen angle, which is
the reference angle this module exists to remove.  Report in degrees by all
means; decide in size.
