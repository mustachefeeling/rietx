"""Intensity corrections a time-of-flight bank needs: incident spectrum, Lorentz,
extinction, and the neutron µ(λ) its absorption correction is built from.

Each reflection's contribution is ``∝ K·F²·H(T − T_ph)`` with
``K = E·A·O·M·L/V`` (Larson & Von Dreele 2004, LAUR 86-748, GSAS Technical
Manual p. 133).  Three of those factors vary with wavelength inside one
histogram, which is what this module is for.

The incident spectrum — the one unit change in the track
---------------------------------------------------------
GSAS normalises a TOF histogram as ``I_o = I′_o/(W·I_i)`` (manual p. 127) and
fits ``I_i`` with one of five functions selected by ``ITYP`` (p. 128-129).
**Their argument is the flight time in milliseconds**, stated three times by
the manual (ITYP 1 and 2 on p. 128, ITYP 4 on p. 129) and again by the file
format (the ``ICOFF`` coefficients "are expressed in terms of TOF in
milliseconds", p. 223).  So the public door takes µs like every other function
in the track and **divides by 1000 exactly once**, at the top of
:func:`incident_intensity`; nothing else here sees a microsecond.

With T in ms and P₁…P_N the coefficients:

The manual prints ITYP 1 and 2 with an ellipsis after the second pair; the
third and fourth pairs (powers T³, T⁴) are Von Dreele, Jorgensen & Windsor
(1982), *J. Appl. Cryst.* **15**, 581, eqs. (4) and (5), p. 583, whose
nine-coefficient series the GSAS forms extend.  The **fifth pair, P₁₀ and
P₁₁, is ``P₁₀·exp(−P₁₁·T⁵)``, established by conformance rather than read**:
the printed series (the manual's p. 128 with VD82's eqs. 4-5) is a ladder of
exponents 1, 2, 3, 4 for the second to fifth terms and stops there, so the sixth term's exponent was measured — 5.000000
(rms 2e-13, the rms doubling at Δk ≈ 1.5e-15) against the incident spectrum
GSAS-II 5.8.2 computes, run as a black box on 2026-09-23 on synthetic
coefficient sets (P₁₁ = 1e-5, 1e-3, 0.1; ITYP 1 and 2) and on the real NPDF
run 7245 bank-2 block, where the term is 17 % of I_i.  No source was read:
the oracle's output is the only evidence, and the law it pins is the next
rung of the printed ladder.  ITYP 4's Chebyshev part is
"part of the Chebyschev polynomial used for TYPE 3" (p. 128), i.e. the same
X = 2/T − 1.  The Chebyshev basis is the three-term recurrence
T₀ = 1, T₁ = X, T_{n+1} = 2X·T_n − T_{n−1} (Abramowitz & Stegun ch. 22, which
the manual cites for its Table 22.3 coefficients).

The Lorentz factor and Sabine extinction
----------------------------------------
``L = d⁴·sin Θ`` for TOF neutrons (manual p. 140): Θ is the bank's fixed
Bragg angle, so only d⁴ varies across a histogram, and there is no
polarisation factor for neutrons.  Sabine's primary-extinction formalism as
tested on TOF data by Sabine, Von Dreele & Jørgensen (1988), *Acta Cryst.*
**A44**, 374-379, eqs. (1)-(7), p. 375, with the refinable parameter the
manual's ``E_x`` in µm² (p. 133), which is (K·D)² for a block of edge D.

µ(λ) for the absorption correction
----------------------------------
``µ(λ) = Σ nᵢ[σ_abs,i·λ/λ₀ + σ_coh,i + σ_inc,i] / V`` — absorption follows the
1/v law and scattering does not, so µ is affine in λ.  λ₀ = 1.798 Å, the
2200 m/s wavelength at which Sears (1992), *Neutron News* **3**(3), 26-37,
tabulates σ_abs.  With σ in barn and V in Å³ the ratio is cm⁻¹ directly.
