"""The incident-spectrum vocabulary a time-of-flight instrument file declares.

GSAS normalises a TOF histogram as ``I_o = I′_o/(W·I_i)`` (Larson & Von Dreele
2004, LAUR 86-748, GSAS Technical Manual p. 127) and fits the incident spectrum
``I_i`` with one of five functions selected by ``ITYP`` (p. 128-129), whose
coefficients an instrument-parameter file writes in its ``ICOFF`` records.
**Their argument is the flight time in milliseconds** (p. 128-129, and again
p. 223 for the file), which is why :class:`rietx.schemas.instrument.IncidentSpectrum`
converts the fitted window to µs on the way in and keeps the coefficients as
written.

With T in ms and P₁…P_N the coefficients:

The manual prints ITYP 1 and 2 with an ellipsis after the second pair; the
third and fourth pairs (powers T³, T⁴) are Von Dreele, Jorgensen & Windsor
(1982), *J. Appl. Cryst.* **15**, 581, eqs. (4) and (5), p. 583.  The fifth
pair's law is not printed anywhere, which is why the strict reader refuses a
non-zero one (:mod:`rietx.io.instrument_tof`).

**This module is the vocabulary, not the evaluator.**  This build reads a
spectrum losslessly and evaluates none: no time-of-flight forward model exists
here yet (yue-here/rietx issue #193), so what a file declares is carried on
the instrument and checked for consistency — a type the manual defines, and
exactly as many coefficients as it uses — and nothing more.
