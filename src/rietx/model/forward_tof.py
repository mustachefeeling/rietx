"""The time-of-flight forward model: a pattern in microseconds from a structure.

The sibling of :mod:`rietx.model.forward`, and a **separate compiled object**
rather than a branch inside :class:`~rietx.model.forward.CompiledModel`.  That
class is an angle from end to end — its grid is ``tt``, it carries a
``wavelength`` and a ``line_wavelengths`` tuple, its positions come from
Bragg's law, its widths are Caglioti polynomials in tan θ, and its intensities
carry a polarisation factor and a Finger-Cox-Jephcoat axial quadrature.  A
time-of-flight bank shares **none** of those five and shares the rest exactly:
the reflection list, the d-spacings, |F|², the multiplicities, the background
and the parameter table are all radiation-blind, and this module reuses them
without a second copy.

What is different, and where each piece comes from
--------------------------------------------------

*Positions.*  ``T_hkl = DIFC·d + DIFA·d² + TZERO + DIFB/d``
(:func:`rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_from_d`; Larson & Von Dreele, 2004,
LAUR 86-748, GSAS Technical Manual p. 141, whose relation is the first three
terms, plus GSAS-II's ``difB``).  The four constants are
:class:`~rietx.schemas.instrument.TOFSource` parameters, so they are read from
the decoded θ on every call and can be refined.

*Shape.*  Two back-to-back exponentials convoluted with a Gaussian (GSAS TOF
profile type 1, :func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.back_to_back_gaussian`) or
with a pseudo-Voigt (type 3,
:func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.back_to_back_pseudovoigt`) — Von Dreele,
Jorgensen & Windsor, 1982, *J. Appl. Cryst.* **15**, 581.  Which one is a
**compile-time structural** choice, taken from whether any γ coefficient is
non-zero or can move this stage, never from a θ-decoded value mid-solve.  The
four shape parameters follow the reflection's d-spacing through
:func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_alpha`, ``tof_beta``, ``tof_sigma_sq`` and
``tof_gamma``.

*Intensity.*  ``I_hkl = S · m_hkl · |F_hkl|² · d⁴·sin θ_bank`` — the
time-of-flight Lorentz factor (GSAS Technical Manual p. 140; Larson & Von
Dreele, 2004).  ``θ_bank`` is **half the bank's fixed scattering angle**, not a
per-reflection quantity: on a TOF bank every reflection is collected at the
same angle and separated by arrival time, which is the whole structural
difference from the constant-wavelength Lorentz factor.  Getting that wrong —
using a per-reflection θ — is the single most plausible mistake here, so the
sine is computed once at compile and stored as a scalar.

*What varies with wavelength inside the histogram.*  Three corrections that a
constant-wavelength model evaluates once per emission line have to be evaluated
along the bank here, because λ is a property of the channel:

* the **incident spectrum** the moderator delivers, which the file declares in
  its ``ITYP`` record and which is a function of the **flight time** (ISIS GEM
  writes ``ITYP 0``, i.e. none — already divided out by its reduction; LANSCE
  NPDF writes ``ITYP 1`` with a full ``ICOFF`` block, i.e. its histograms still
  carry it; a non-zero fifth pair there is refused by
  :mod:`rietx.model.tof_spectrum`, its exponent being unpublished).  Applied **per channel**, to the calculated Bragg sum and not to
  the background — :meth:`CompiledTOFModel.incident_spectrum` and
  :mod:`rietx.model.tof_spectrum`;
* the **channel width** W(T), the other half of the same one-line relation
  (manual PAGE 127, verbatim: *"The general expressions for the intensity of
  TOF data are I_o = I'_o / W I_i … where I'_o is the number of counts
  observed in a channel of width W"*).  A calculated Bragg sum is a density,
  so a histogram holding *counts* owes it a factor of W and one already
  divided by W does not — which is a fact about the file, declared on the
  pattern (:attr:`~rietx.schemas.pattern.PatternData.intensity_basis`) and
  never inferred.  W is measured from the pattern's **own abscissa**, because
  a ``TIME_MAP`` bank's widths are tabulated in the data and are in no
  instrument file: :meth:`CompiledTOFModel.channel_width_factor`;
* **specimen absorption**, whose µ follows the 1/v law, so µR runs linearly
  with λ across the bank.  Applied **per reflection** at λ_hkl, which is where
  GSAS applies it (manual PAGE 134);
* **secondary extinction**, whose Sabine variable carries λ² and so runs as
  λ⁴-ish across the bank.  Also per reflection, through exactly the
  constant-wavelength :func:`~rietx.model.extinction.sabine_extinction` with an
  array of wavelengths where a scalar used to go.

Absorption is **computed, never refined**: the manual's own warning (PAGE 134,
verbatim) is that *"the correction is indistinguishable from thermal motion
effects and should not be refined"*, and a scalar ``Geometry.mu_r`` is refused
on this arm because it is a claim at one wavelength.  Preferred orientation,
Stephens strain and soft restraints stay refused, each naming its rung.

Units, once
-----------
Flight time and every ΔT in **microseconds**; d in Å; DIFC µs/Å, DIFA µs/Å²,
TZERO µs, DIFB µs·Å; α and β in µs⁻¹; the ``sig`` coefficients are
**variances** in µs², µs²/Å², µs²/Å⁴ (not FWHMs, and not squared again — see
:func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_sigma_sq`); the ``gam`` coefficients are a
Lorentzian **FWHM** in µs.  ΔT = channel − peak, so β < α puts the tail at long
flight time.  A ``.iparm``'s ``ITYP`` window and its spectrum functions are in
*milli*seconds and are the one place in this track where the unit changes; the
conversion happens once, at :mod:`rietx.model.tof_spectrum`'s door, so nothing
in this module carries a millisecond.  µ is in cm⁻¹ and µR is dimensionless.

#: Where the incident spectrum is evaluated.  T-1b declared this name for a
#: seam that returned 1.0; the method now evaluates the function the file
#: declared, and the constant is kept because it is what a caller overriding
#: the spectrum — a reduction that measured its own, an ``ITYP 10``
#: point-by-point file — is pointed at.
INCIDENT_SPECTRUM_HOOK = "rietx.model.forward_tof.CompiledTOFModel.incident_spectrum"

#: The fraction of a peak this arm's frozen window may discard **on each side
#: separately**, and per component.  The flight-time arm's own tolerance, two
#: orders under :data:`~rietx.model.forward.WINDOW_AREA_TOL`, and the reason it
#: needs one is a measurement rather than a preference.
#:
#: A constant-wavelength peak is symmetric, so a 2 %-of-area window truncates
#: both sides alike and the truncation is very nearly a *scale* on the
#: reflection — which the phase scale absorbs, and which was measured as no
#: material bias.  The
#: back-to-back-exponential peak is not symmetric, and its asymmetry is a
#: function of α and β, i.e. of the very parameters a stage refines.  So the
#: truncated fraction moves *between candidate solutions*, and a window frozen
#: for the stage turns that into a term in χ² that depends on where the model
#: was compiled rather than on where it is.  Measured on SNS NOMAD's Si SRM
#: 640c bank tof-1 at 2 %: a
#: **42-unit** penalty in 1941 at one state against 1.4 at another 5 × 10⁻³ Å
#: away, enough to move the χ² minimum by eleven of its own σ and to make an
#: uphill step score as downhill.
#:
#: 1e-4 was **chosen by measurement**, on that same bank and those same two
#: states, sweeping the whole window rule and nothing else (T-3b's report has
#: the run).  "Penalty" is χ²(this rule) − χ²(this rule + 500 µs of extra
#: slack), i.e. what the frozen window costs at that state:
#:
#: ========= ============ ============ ================== ============
#: rule      penalty A    penalty B    points per window  ms per eval
#: ========= ============ ============ ================== ============
#: shipped   42.04        1.35         45.6               0.28
#: 1e-3      1.80         0.20         54.9               0.32
#: **1e-4**  **0.015**    **−0.003**   **63.7**           **0.34**
#: 1e-5      −0.004       0.0002       71.0               0.38
#: 1e-6      −0.001       0.0000       78.6               0.42
#: ========= ============ ============ ================== ============
#:
#: 1e-4 is the knee, and the criterion is not the penalty alone but the
#: *difference between the two states*, which is what a solver actually walks
#: on: it runs 40.97 under the shipped rule, 1.88 at 1e-3 and **0.296** at
#: 1e-4, against 0.277 at 1e-6 — converged to two decimals for 40 % more
#: points and 21 % more time.  1e-3 would meet a 2-unit bar and would meet it
#: with no margin at all.
#:
#: **What it costs on the pseudo-Voigt branch, and it is not small.**  The
#: exponential wings grow like log(1/tol), which is cheap; the Lorentzian half
#: of a resolution function does not, since k ≈ η/(π·tol) — 1e-4 is ~160 FWHM
#: per unit η against the constant-wavelength rule's 1.6.  Measured on a
#: synthetic Si bank at three γ₁, shipped rule against this one:
#:
#: ======== ============= ================= ==================
#: γ₁       η(max)        ms/eval, shipped  ms/eval, this rule
#: ======== ============= ================= ==================
#: 0        0 (Gaussian)  0.15              0.14
#: 2        0.064         1.26              15.4
#: 10       0.274         1.77              43.3
#: ======== ============= ================= ==================
#:
#: So the Gaussian branch is free — the shorter exponential wings pay for the
#: wider Gaussian extent, k(0) being 1.58 here against the CW rule's 0.99 —
#: and the type-3 branch is 12-24× slower.  It is shipped that way because the
#: tolerance is the *statement*, and every real bank obtainable for this track
#: (SNS NOMAD, LANSCE NPDF, ISIS GEM) declares γ = 0 and compiles the Gaussian
#: branch.  If a γ-carrying bank ever makes this the bottleneck, the thing to
#: change is a **separate, stated** tolerance for the Lorentzian component —
#: not a quiet cap on this one, which is the unstated bias WP-1112 removed.
TOF_WINDOW_AREA_TOL = 1e-4

#: How many e-foldings of each exponential wing a frozen window must hold —
#: **derived** from the tolerance above rather than chosen beside it, so the
#: two halves of one window cannot state two different bars.  The back-to-back
#: pulse decays as e^{−α|ΔT|} on the short-flight-time side and e^{−βΔT} on the
#: long one, and the mass beyond ``k`` e-foldings of either is at most e^{−k},
#: so ``−ln(tol)`` is exactly the sizing that leaves ``tol`` of it outside.
#:
#: The two wings are sized **separately**, which is the whole point: β < α is
#: the normal case and makes the long-flight-time tail several times the short
#: one, so a symmetric window either truncates the tail or pays for it twice.
#: And the exponential and resolution extents are **added**, which is a bound
#: and not an approximation: the profile is a convolution, so the displacement
#: is a sum of two independent ones and P(E + R > h_E + h_R) ≤ P(E > h_E) +
#: P(R > h_R).  The window therefore discards at most ``2·TOF_WINDOW_AREA_TOL``
#: per side, and that is a *stated* bound rather than an accident of the
#: margin — which is what the 2 %-of-area rule was here.
TAIL_EFOLDS = -math.log(TOF_WINDOW_AREA_TOL)

#: Absolute slack in µs added to every window half-width, and the fraction of
#: the peak's own flight time added beside it.  Movement headroom, not tail
#: coverage: windows are frozen per stage while the cell, DIFC and TZERO move
#: inside it, and a cell error is *relative* (0.5 % of d is 0.5 % of T, i.e.
#: 200 µs at T = 40 000 µs) while a TZERO error is *absolute*.  So the slack
#: has to be both.  A stage that starts further out than this recompiles and
#: converges on the second pass, which is what ``Refinement`` does anyway.
WINDOW_MIN_US = 3.0
WINDOW_SLACK_FRAC = 2.0e-3

#: A bank whose α or β is not positive cannot make a peak: the back-to-back
#: pulse has amplitude αβ/(α+β) and infinite width at either limit.  An
#: all-zero :class:`~rietx.schemas.instrument.ProfileTOF` is a real state — it
#: is what a ``.iparm`` whose ``PRCF`` block was declined leaves behind (T-1's
#: D2) — so this is refused by name at compile rather than producing a pattern
#: of zeros nobody can explain.

    The four :class:`~rietx.schemas.structure.Phase` sample-width parameters
    read as the **specimen quantities** a time-of-flight bank can use:
    ``size_*`` is K/L in Å⁻¹ and ``strain_*`` is Δd/d, both FWHMs, both free
    of any wavelength and any angle
    (:func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_sample_gamma`,
    :func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_sample_sigma_sq`).

    **The two pairs are stored differently, and the asymmetry is WP-1131's.**
    A microstrain coefficient is λ-free: ``lor_strain`` is the same number of
    degrees on every instrument, so a bank reads the stored coefficient
    through the constant-wavelength arm's own conversion and the two arms
    share one column with one meaning.  A *size* coefficient is not: it is
    (180/π)·K·λ/L, so a number of degrees is a length only through a
    wavelength, and a bank has none —
    :attr:`CompiledTOFModel.wavelength` refuses to invent one.  So on a
    ``neutron_tof`` table ``lor_size`` holds K/L in Å⁻¹ and ``gauss_size``
    its square in Å⁻², the d-space form
    (:func:`~rietx.model.profiles.caglioti.apparent_size_from_d_size_coefficient`),
    and :func:`~rietx.params.multi.size_value_scales` — which is where a joint
    fit knows what its reference wavelength is — converts between the two
    units so that one shared column is one crystallite in every histogram.

    The Gaussian pair are **variances** in both arms' units and are handed on
    as variances: (K/L)² in Å⁻² and (Δd/d)², which is what
    :func:`~rietx.model.profiles.tof.tof_sample_sigma_sq` takes.  Squaring the
    *coefficient* rather than the width is what keeps a square root out of the
    residual, and (5) being linear is what makes the strain variance a plain
    multiple of ``gauss_strain``.

    ``.get`` rather than ``[]`` for :meth:`CompiledTOFModel.phase_peaks`'s
    reason: it is public and is called with hand-built value dicts by plots,
    exporters and replay, and a dict that does not mention a sample width
    means a phase that declares none — which is rietx's default and is an
    exact zero, not a missing number.

    **Unconditional arithmetic, through the backend.**  No branch on a value:
    this runs inside the residual on every traced backend, where a value is a
    tracer and a python ``float()`` or a ``> 0.0`` is not available, and where
    a branch on a parameter would bake one side of it into the trace.  Every
    term is exactly zero at rietx's zero defaults, so the branch would buy
    nothing anyway — which is the purity rule
    :func:`~rietx.model.profiles.caglioti.gaussian_fwhm` states one module
    over.  ``maximum(·, 0.0)`` guards only the square roots, and only against a
    value the softplus transform's floor already excludes.

        makes, for the same reason: the scatter is a ``bincount`` and the loop
        is the oracle that says the two agree.  Measured on ISIS GEM bank 4
        (YAG, Ia-3d, a = 12 A; 4501 reflections over 2366 channels, 860313
        flat window entries): **338 ms** per phase through the loop against
        **85 ms** batched, and the two arrays agree with ``max|delta| = 0.0``
        -- bit for bit, not to rounding, because the ``bincount`` scatters the
        same terms the windowed adds do.  4x matters here because a
        finite-difference Jacobian is one evaluation per free parameter per
        iteration.

        **The incident spectrum and the channel width are applied here, once,
        to the summed Bragg contribution**, and they are the only place in this
        class where a correction is per *channel* rather than per reflection.
        They have to be: GSAS's own operation is a point-by-point division of
        the observed counts (manual PAGE 127, ``I_o = I'_o / W·I_i``), so the
        faithful multiplication is point by point too, and a peak whose Δd/d is
        a per cent sits across a per cent of the envelope.  The two are the two
        factors of that one relation, and they are applied together here for
        that reason rather than being spread over two call sites.

        The background is deliberately **not** multiplied by either — it is
        fitted in the observed space, so whatever they do to it is already in
        the coefficients the background refines, and applying the shape there
        as well would apply it twice.

    """``(a, b)`` with µR(λ) = a·λ + b for the packed specimen, or ``None``.

    ``None`` — the correction off — when the geometry declares no capillary
    radius, which is what "nobody asked" looks like and is the same gate the
    constant-wavelength path uses (``refine._resolve_specimen_absorption`` only
    acts when a specimen dimension is declared).

    Three things are decided here rather than per evaluation, and each is
    frozen for the stage exactly as the constant-wavelength model freezes its
    scalar µR:

    **The composition, from the compiled orbits.**  Site multiplicities come
    from ``PhaseSites.ops`` — the orbits the *forward model* used — rather than
    from a second symmetry expansion, so µ can never be computed over a
    different cell content than |F|² was.  **Species are kept whole**: a
    neutron's cross-section depends on the isotope (¹H at 80.27 barn incoherent
    against ²H at 2.05), so the counts are keyed on the species label and not
    reduced to an element the way an X-ray composition legitimately is.

    **The volume fractions, from the scales and the cell volumes, with no
    masses involved.**  Hill-Howard gives W_p ∝ S_p·(ZMV)_p with ZMV = cell
    mass × cell volume, and a volume fraction is W_p/ρ_p with ρ_p ∝ cell
    mass/cell volume — so the cell mass cancels exactly and **v_p ∝ S_p·V_p²**.
    That is the whole weighting, and it needs no atomic weights, no formula
    units and no import from ``optimize.qpa`` (whose ``element_counts`` reduce
    isotopes to elements and would be wrong here for the reason above).  All
    scales zero — a model that has not been scaled yet — falls back to equal
    volumes, which is what ``qpa`` does and says.

    **The domain is reported, not enforced.**  Rouse et al. (1970) fit the
    cylinder integral over 0 ≤ µR ≤ 1 and past that the two-term exponential is
    an extrapolation with no stated error — but a Gd or Cd specimen really is
    that absorbing, and refusing to fit one would be a harder line than the
    constant-wavelength path takes with the same expression
    (``ABSORPTION_MU_R_OUT_OF_RANGE`` is a *warning* there).  So the model
    carries :attr:`CompiledTOFModel.mu_r_range` — µR at the two ends of the
    fitted window — and ``refine`` reports it, with the same warning at the
    same threshold.  What is new here is that **the two ends differ**: µ rises
    with λ, so a bank can be well inside the domain at 1 Å and outside it at
    4 Å, which a single number cannot say.
