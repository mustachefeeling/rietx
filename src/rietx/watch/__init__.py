"""``rietx watch`` — a window into the refinements under a directory.

With no argument it scans the working directory and lists every run beneath it,
live ones and finished ones together, and opening one shows its plot and its
event log. With a directory argument that *is* a run it opens straight onto
that run, so ``rietx watch live/`` keeps working exactly as it did.

This module is **transport only**, the split ``gui/server.py`` declares for
itself. Finding runs, deciding whether one is still being written and tailing
its log are :mod:`rietx.runs`, which has no HTTP in it and which
``gui/session.py`` can import when it attaches to a foreign run.

**The page is files, in** ``static/`` (WP-1430): an ``index.html``, a
stylesheet and two ES modules, served by :meth:`_Handler._static`. It was a
python string until seven WPs queued up against it, at which point the string
was costing an editor, a unit test and every merge. ``watch-core.mjs`` is the
half that touches no DOM and the suite runs it through ``node --test``;
``watch.mjs`` owns the document. What the page cannot know about this build
travels on the first ``/api/runs`` (:func:`_page_constants`).

**The watcher has two verbs** (WP-1405, WP-1428). Everything else reads: it
opens no project and constructs no refinement. ``POST /api/run/<id>/cancel``
writes :data:`~rietx.runs.CANCEL_FILE` into a directory the walk already
offered, and the fit's own token is what acts on it. ``POST
/api/run/<id>/gui`` spawns a GUI on a throwaway copy of the run's project.
``--read-only`` serves without either, for a reader who is not the person who
should be stopping things.

**Neither verb touches the project the fit is writing.** Stopping writes into
the *run* directory. The GUI launch copies the project first and opens the
copy, because there is no read-only way to open one and two appenders on one
``history.jsonl`` is the interleaving WP-1403 separated the run directories to
avoid. The copy is frozen at the click and never follows the fit.

**A click here raises in another process.** That is the sharpest fact in this
module: a fit that did not ask to be cancellable is cancellable, and a script
that does not catch ``RefinementCancelled`` prints a traceback. It is why the
button takes two clicks, why the dialog says so in as many words, and why it
has no keyboard shortcut.

Run the refinement in one process::

    ref.fit(data, events=LiveSession("live/"))

and the viewer in another::

    rietx watch                  # every run under the working directory
    rietx watch live/            # straight onto one

    Returns the server when ``block=False``. A directory that is itself a run
    is served as one and the page opens straight onto it.

    ``allow_cancel=False`` serves without the stop verb, and the page draws no
    button (``--read-only``). ``allow_gui=False`` does the same for the GUI
    launch (WP-1428); ``--read-only`` clears both.

    **Stopping is on by default, and that was the decision** (WP-1405). The
    argument for the other way is real: a click here raises in a process the
    reader cannot see, and making that a deliberate act by requiring a flag is
    cheap. Three things settled it the other way. The server binds
    ``127.0.0.1``, so the only person who can click is the person at the
    machine the fit is running on — who can already reach it with Ctrl-C, which
    raises in that process too. A flag you have to have set *in advance* is not
    there when a runaway starts, and killing the watcher to restart it with the
    flag is the moment you needed it. And the dialog already makes it a
    deliberate act, twice over. ``--read-only`` covers the case the argument is
    really about: a reader who is not the person who should be stopping things,
    which is a situation you know about beforehand.
