"""What the fit says about a moment, and what the powder could not see.

Three statements, per magnetic site, and each of them is a thing a moment
model can get wrong in a way Rwp does not show:

1. **The magnitude, with its esd.**  |m| is the refined modulus DOF, so it is
   a column of the least-squares problem and its esd comes from the same
   covariance every other parameter's does — Bérar-Lelann inflation included
   (``Statistics.esd_inflation`` divides it back out).  The crystal-axis
   components beside it are *derived*: they carry no esd, because the direction
   they encode is either undeterminable (in which case an esd would be a number
   about nothing) or determined, in which case the angle DOF carries it.

2. **The direction the powder cannot determine.**  A cubic collinear structure
   measures |m| and nothing about its direction; a uniaxial one measures the
   angle to the unique axis and nothing about the azimuth (Shirane, 1959,
   *Acta Cryst.* **12**, 282).  Those directions come back **held**, with the
   DOF named, rather than as a small number with a small esd.

3. **Which approximation is in force.**  f(s) = ⟨j₀⟩ for a spin-only 3d ion,
   f(s) = ⟨j₀⟩ + (2/g − 1)⟨j₂⟩ for a rare earth — the difference FullProf's
   table names apart as ``MHO3`` and ``JHO3`` for the same ion.  A report that
   does not say which one it used cannot be checked.

And the fourth statement, which is a refusal rather than a number: a moment
whose modulus sits at its floor is **unsupported**, not small.  |F_m|² ∝ m², so
the column vanishes with the moment; a paramagnetic pattern drives the modulus
to nothing and every direction flat with it, and the honest report of that is
"the data does not support a moment here", not "0.02(1) μ_B".

    identically zero and the moment was never observed.  The test is
    ``cp.magnetic``, the frozen block the compile attaches exactly when
    ``forward.magnetic_wanted`` says so, so this function needs no opinion
    about radiations of its own.

    **Nothing here reads the abscissa**: the
    modulus, its esd, the crystal-axis components, the approximation in force

    would have called this the same rank deficiency, pre-fit, on the
    candidate's own amplitude Jacobian) — see :func:`_pair_degenerate_moments`.
    ``None`` (the default) leaves every row exactly as before Q5: a fit whose
    top-|ρ| list was not passed in, or that never measured one, reports each
    modulus on its own, which is the honest state when nothing said otherwise

    mask is exact where it applies — a k = 0 magnetic space group drops the
    parent's glide and screw operations, and the rows ``magnetic_reflections``
    adds for that carry an identically zero nuclear structure factor — but it
    marks only *those* rows.  On a **k ≠ 0 supercell** the strong magnetic
    reflections are in the child group's own reflection list with the mask set
    to 1.0, and their nuclear |F|² is zero because the nuclear atoms still
    carry the parent's translation: measured on a Pnma → P2₁/m

    the *magnetic* component alone, so they are identifiable exactly to the
    extent that the magnetic/nuclear intensity ratio **differs across
    reflections**: a k ≠ 0 structure with magnetic-only satellites measures
    them, a k = 0 collinear structure whose magnetic and nuclear intensities
    track each other does not, and a paramagnetic pattern has no magnetic

    and a moment of the same size is not.

    ``moved`` is the set of paths a ``MAGNETIC_WIDTH_MOVED_MOMENT`` already
    named in this fit, and it changes what this row is allowed to say. The two
    codes answer different questions — support versus shift — and on a real
    dataset they disagree: on Ba₂FeSbSe₅ at 1.5 K the strain term is 1.33 esd
    (so "unmeasured") while releasing it moves the tied moment by 1.40 of the
    off-state fit's own esd. Left in its plain wording this row would then
    read as licence to drop a term that is carrying 0.18 μ_B of the answer, so
    where the other code fired this one **says so and withholds that licence**
    rather than repeating the ratio as if it settled the matter.

    And a correction to the WP's own expectation, measured rather than
    assumed.  It expects an unmeasurable width back as an **absent** esd and a
    named ``ParameterTable.unmeasured_rows`` entry.  That is not what happens,
    for the reason WP-1327 already recorded one rank down: ``unmeasured_rows``
    fires on an **exactly zero** column, and a magnetic width's column is not
    zero on a k = 0 structure — the magnetic component really is broadened,
    the pattern really does change, and what fails is only the *separation*
    from everything else that broadens a peak there.  Measured on LaMnO₃ at
    50 K: ``magnetic_lor_size`` 0.0287 with an esd of 0.0615, i.e. an esd
    larger than the value, no held row and no zero column.  So the honest
    report is a **ratio**, exactly as WP-1327's "unsupported" is, and this
    diagnostic is what names the path instead of leaving a reader to divide.

    """``MAGNETIC_WIDTH_UNMODELLED`` — the residual's *shape*, not a width.

    Issue #277 asks for observed FWHM ÷ calculated FWHM per reflection.  This
    package cannot compute the numerator: there is no observed-peak-width
    measurement in it, and the one that is coming is v1.4's ``fit_peaks``
    (WP-1101), which this arm deliberately neither waits on nor duplicates.

    The signature is available without it.  A calculated peak that is too
    narrow under a broad observed one leaves a **sign-structured** residual:
    negative in the middle, positive in both tails.  The low moment the fit
    has already taken does not erase that, it only moves where the two cross
    — least squares trades centre against tails and cannot make both zero
    with the wrong width.  So the statistic is the centre-versus-tails split
    of the *weighted* residual, and it is read off the converged residual the
    report already holds rather than from a trial solve.

    **Differencing the two sets is what makes it safe.**  The split is
    evaluated at the magnetic-only reflections and at the nuclear-only ones,
    and only the difference is judged: a wrong instrument profile, a wrong
    ``lor_size``, a wrong background and an unmodelled specimen aberration all
    move the two sets together and cancel, and only a *component-specific*
    width difference survives.  Its noise is estimated from the same channels
    (the pooled sample s.d. of the weighted residual over the channels read),
    so a fit whose GoF is 3 is judged against its own scatter and not against
    an assumed unit variance.

    Fires only where **both magnetic width terms are held at zero** — which
    the compiled model states structurally: the second frozen family exists
    exactly when they can differ from the nuclear widths
    (:meth:`~rietx.model.forward.CompiledModel.mag_split`), so a stage that
    freed the term is a stage this arm has nothing to say about.  The evidence
    for a freed term is the trajectory instead — the stage that freed it is a
    rung on ``stage_reports_`` and the moment before and after is a record the
    plan already produces (WP-1058, WP-1073).

    It never quotes an Rwp comparison as its evidence (root ``CLAUDE.md``),
    and it says which way the moment would move: **up**, because |F_m|² ∝ m²
    and the only way a too-narrow calculated peak can match a broad observed
    one's height is by taking the moment down.
