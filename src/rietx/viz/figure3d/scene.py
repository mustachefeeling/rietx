"""The structure viewer's scene rules and views, ported from TypeScript (WP-1470).

``gui/src/lib/structure3d.ts`` turns the geometry ``rietx.gui.structure3d.build``
returns into the ``Scene`` the GUI's renderer draws, and builds the ``View`` it
draws it from.  :func:`render_structure` draws the same picture without a
browser, so it needs the same two answers, and this module is their second
copy.  A second copy of a rule is a drift hazard with no natural alarm, so the
two are held equal case by case: ``tests/test_render_structure.py`` writes
``tests/data/gui/scene_cases.json`` from the functions here, and
``structure3d.test.ts`` replays every case against ``buildScene``, ``lookFrom``
and ``axisView``.  Python owns the rules and TypeScript proves it states them.

So every function here is a line-for-line port of the one it names, down to
its rounding (``Math.round`` rounds a half up, where python's ``round`` rounds
it to even) and its degenerate branches.  A change to a rule is made in both
files in one commit, and the corpus fails until it is.

The scene is plain lists and dicts with the TypeScript field names, so the
corpus is the scene itself.  The renderer packs it into arrays.
