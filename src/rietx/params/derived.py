"""Derived blocks: nonlinear maps applied after the affine constraint block.

The parameter table's one affine block, p = C·p_free + d, cannot carry a rigid
body: a body atom's fractional coordinates x = o + M⁻¹·Exp(δω)·R₀·r are not
affine in the rotation increment δω.  WP-1803 measured the two candidate seams
and recorded the decision in ``docs/DESIGN.md`` § Parameter system ("Rigid
bodies: a typed ``derived`` block"): the exact map is applied in ``decode``
*after* the affine matmul, and every reader of C that has to know what a
derived row depends on reads the block's **local Jacobian at θ** (esds, the
restraint block) or its **declared reach** (the pattern readers), never C's
anchor rows (WP-1804).

A block is a closed-form map from declared *input* entries (physical values,
in table units: Å, degrees, radians for an increment) to declared *output*
entries.  The outputs are locked entries of the table: they have no row in C
and no free column, so ``set_vary`` can never free one, and the block alone
writes them.  Three things a block owes the table, each stated so a new kind
of block cannot leave one out:

* :meth:`DerivedBlock.evaluate` — the map on the numpy path (``decode``,
  ``commit``, every esd reader);
* :meth:`DerivedBlock.jacobian` — ∂outputs/∂inputs at the current inputs,
  **exact**, never a finite difference of :meth:`evaluate` (the table chains
  it through C and through any earlier block to get ∂p/∂p_free);
* :meth:`DerivedBlock.evaluate_traced` — the same map in ``xp`` ops, so the
  traced twin of ``decode`` (``backend.traced.make_traced_decode``) applies it
  after its dense matmul and an autodiff backend differentiates it;
* :meth:`DerivedBlock.reach_pattern` — which output depends on which input,
  **declared** from the map's structure rather than read off the Jacobian's
  numbers.  An instantaneous zero is not independence: on WP-1803's planar
  test body one rotation column's numeric reach was 28 rows where its declared
  reach is 42, and a freeze resting on the numeric reading would be wrong the
  moment the body turned.

Blocks are applied **in declaration order**, so a later block may read an
earlier block's outputs (a hydrogen riding on a body atom); the table refuses
a block that reads an output declared after it.

The Cartesian frame every body map uses is the closed form below, in ``xp``
ops, because the traced twin cannot call ``numpy.linalg.cholesky``
(``backend/traced.py``).  It is the frame :func:`rietx.crystallography.adp.
cartesian_basis` returns (x ∥ a, y in the a–b plane, z ∥ a × b — the Cholesky
factor of G with a positive diagonal is unique), pinned by
``tests/test_derived_block.py`` over 2000 random cells.
