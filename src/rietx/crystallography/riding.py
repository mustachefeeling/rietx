"""Riding hydrogens on a rigid body: which X–H length, for which radiation (WP-1810).

A hydrogen in a rigid body rides with it: its template point is fixed relative
to its parent atom, so it adds no parameter.  What has to be chosen is the
**length** of the parent–H vector, and the right one depends on what the data
measure:

* **X-ray** data see the hydrogen's electron density, which the bond pulls
  toward the parent, so the refined X–H is 0.1–0.15 Å shorter than the
  internuclear distance.  The convention is SHELXL's riding-model defaults
  (Sheldrick 2015, *Acta Cryst.* C71, 3–8, and the SHELXL ``AFIX``/``HFIX``
  documentation it describes): aromatic and sp² C–H 0.93 Å, tertiary C–H
  0.98, CH₂ 0.97, CH₃ 0.96, hydroxyl O–H 0.82, N–H 0.86 Å.  These are the
  room-temperature defaults a molecular template usually carries.
* **Neutron** data see the nucleus, so the length is the internuclear mean:
  Allen, Watson, Brammer, Orpen & Taylor, *International Tables for
  Crystallography* Vol. C (2006), § 9.5, Table 9.5.1.1 (pp. 801, 808), whose
  X–H rows are from neutron structures only (its Note 21) and uncorrected for
  libration: aromatic C–H 1.083, C=C–H 1.077, X₃C–H 1.099, X₂C–H₂ 1.092,
  C–CH₃ 1.059, alcohol O–H 0.967, acid O–H 1.015 Å.  Table 9.5.1.1 has no
  N–H row in the source rows held here, so ``"NH"`` has no neutron length and
  is refused rather than guessed.
* **A joint X-ray + neutron fit takes the neutron lengths**: the hydrogen's
  scattering signal is in the neutron histogram (a design choice of this
  package), and the X-ray pattern barely constrains it.  So
  :func:`riding_radiation` answers ``"neutron"`` whenever any histogram is
  neutron.
