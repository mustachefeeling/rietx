"""Average atomic volumes in molecular crystals, and the volume of one formula
unit they predict (Hofmann 2002).

A chemist who knows the formula knows roughly how much room one formula unit
takes in a crystal.  Kempster & Lipson (1972, *Acta Cryst.* B28, 3674) put it
at about 18 Å³ per C, N or O atom, hydrogen excluded.  They fitted that on
forty crystals and quote it as accurate to about 10 %, "only for a first
estimate".  Hofmann (2002) replaced the one number with an average volume per
element, fitted to 182 239 structures in the Cambridge Structural Database.
On that set the standard deviation of V_obs/V_est is 4.00 % for his table and
9.04 % for the 18 Å³ rule (§ 3).  So this module carries Hofmann's table, and
the 18 Å³ rule is cited only as its predecessor.

**The table** is Hofmann's Table 2, transcribed from the published PDF and
checked against the page image.  The page footer misprints the volume as B57.
:data:`HOFMANN_VOLUMES` maps an element to (v̄, Δv) in Å³ at 298 K.  Δv is the
mean error of the average (his eq. 11), never the scatter of one crystal.
Sixteen elements are absent, because the table prints a dash for each: He, Ne,
Ar, Kr, Pm, Po, At, Rn, Fr, Ra, Pu, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es and Fm.  Ac (74 Å³) and
Am (17 Å³) carry a volume and no mean error, since each occurs in one
structure (§ 3).  A formula holding either therefore has no esd.  Am's 17 Å³ is
small beside its neighbours, and it is kept as printed.  The table's other two
columns, Mighell et al. (1987) and their difference, are not Hofmann's values
and are not carried.

**Temperature.**  Eq. (1) writes V = Σ nᵢ v̄ᵢ (1 + ᾱT), with
ᾱ = (0.95 ± 0.03) × 10⁻⁴ K⁻¹ (§ 3).  The regression behind it, eqs (6) and
(7), folds the intercept at T = 0 into the volumes, so T there is absolute.
Table 2's caption and § 3 state the tabulated volumes at 298 K.  This module
therefore scales a tabulated volume by (1 + ᾱT)/(1 + ᾱ·298 K).  Reading the
table itself as the T = 0 volumes would make every 298 K volume 2.8 % larger.

**Two uncertainties, for two questions.**  The esd of a formula-unit volume is
eq. (13)'s: the mean errors add linearly, as Σ nᵢ Δvᵢ, and the expansion term
adds in quadrature.  It says how well the average is known, about 0.5 % for an
organic.  One crystal scatters about that average by far more.  The standard
deviation of V_obs/V_est is 4.00 % over the structures within 20 % of the
estimate (§ 3, Fig. 1).  Only 6049 of sample 1's 9112 structures lie within 5 %
(Table 1).  :data:`VOLUME_SCATTER` is that 4.00 %, and a check on one crystal
uses it.

**Scope.**  The table is fitted to organic and metal-organic crystals.  Hofmann
found 496 structures overestimated by 25-75 %, often highly ionic with small
cells, and says the volumes may not apply to inorganic substances (§ 3 (iii)).
Solvent the formula leaves out makes a cell larger than the estimate (513
structures underestimated by 25-75 %, § 3 (ii)).

**The window.**  :data:`VOLUME_RATIO_BOUNDS` is the 25 % boundary of § 3,
V_obs/V_est from 0.8 to 1.25 (Table 3's caption defines the lower edge).
1746 of the 182 239 structures lie beyond it.  737 of those are off by more
than 75 %, mainly because the database's Z was wrong.  A search window must not
exclude the true cell, so it takes this wide boundary rather than the 4 %
scatter.
