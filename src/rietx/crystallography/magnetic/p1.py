"""A structure restated in P1: every atom of the cell listed, each with its moment.

The forward model never lists the cell.  It stores an asymmetric unit and, per
atom, the operations that generate its distinct images
(:func:`~rietx.crystallography.structure_factor.select_orbit_ops`), and a moment
rides each image through the matching operation of the magnetic group
(:func:`~.scattering._axial_matrices`).  :func:`restate_phase_in_p1` runs that
expansion once and writes the result down as a phase of ``P 1`` with magnetic
group 1.1: a plain list of atoms, each carrying its own position, occupancy,
displacement and moment, and nothing left for a symmetry operator to supply.

**What it is for.**  The list is what a program with no symmetry-generating
magnetic model can state (a TOPAS ``str`` in P1 with ``mag_space_group 1.1``),
and it is the check on a moment that does not depend on the operator
bookkeeping that produced it: the moment of every atom of the cell, in one
place, to be read, plotted or compared.  rietx's own prediction from the
restatement equals its prediction from the original, which is the positive
arm of the tests.

**The conventions are the model's own.**

* A position is ``R·x + t`` for each operation of the nuclear subset the forward
  model chose (one per distinct image), wrapped into [0, 1).
* A moment is ``ε·det(R)·R·m`` with the matching operation of the magnetic group
  (``MagneticOperator.moment_matrix``: an **axial** vector, and ε = −1 for a
  primed operation or an anti-translation), in the crystal-axis components, in
  μ_B, that :class:`~rietx.schemas.structure.Moment` stores.  Time reversal is
  therefore in the answer: dropping it from one operation changes the moment of
  every image that operation reaches.
* A displacement tensor is the rotated ``U* → R·U*·Rᵀ`` of the structure factor
  (:func:`~rietx.crystallography.structure_factor._aniso_dw`), held in the CIF
  ``U^ij`` convention.

**Every parameter of the restatement is held.**  The copies are one value each:
the ties that made them one parameter (a site symmetry, an operator relation,
the cell's metric constraints) are not stated in P1, so freeing a copy would
refine a different model.  The restatement is for checking and export, and a
refinement starts from the original.  A k ≠ 0 structure is already a
commensurate supercell here (``MagneticSymmetry.propagation_vector_parent`` is
provenance only), so it restates like any other phase and the parent k is not
carried.
