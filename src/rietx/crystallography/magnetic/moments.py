"""How a moment enters θ: a modulus and the angles the site symmetry leaves free.

A moment is stored as crystal-axis components (``Atom.moment``) and refined
through ``phases.i.atoms.j.moment.dof<k>``.  The DOFs are **not** the components
and not their coefficients on the allowed basis either, and the reason is the
one thing a powder cannot do.

**Why modulus and angles.**  After the Laue-orbit average a powder measures
|m| for a cubic collinear structure and nothing at all about its direction
(Shirane, G., 1959, *Acta Cryst.* **12**, 282); for a uniaxial structure it
measures |m| and the angle to the unique axis, and nothing about the azimuth.
Those are *flat directions of θ*, and the package already has one rule for a
flat direction: an equilibrated normal matrix, a gradient-free column named by
``ParameterTable.unmeasured_rows``, and an esd that is **absent** rather than
zero.  For that rule to fire, the undeterminable quantity has to *be a column*.
Parameterising by components — or by coefficients on the allowed basis — puts
the flat direction along a rotation that no single column owns, so every
component comes back unmeasured and the magnitude, which the data *does*
determine, comes back with no esd at all.  Modulus-and-angles splits them:
the modulus is a column with a gradient and an esd, the angles are columns
without one exactly when the powder cannot see them.

**The frame.**  The allowed subspace is M-5's
:func:`~rietx.crystallography.magnetic.operators.allowed_moment_basis` — an
integer basis of crystal-axis directions, ∩ ker(ε·det(R)·R − I) over the site's
magnetic stabiliser.  It is *not* orthonormal, and the crystal-axis basis is
oblique whenever the cell is, so the frame here is Gram-Schmidt **in the
magCIF unit-vector metric** (ones on the diagonal, cos of the cell angles off
it).  That is what makes the modulus equal |m| in the sense the CIF defines it:
on hexagonal axes the moment (1, 1, 0) is 1 μ_B, not √2.

**The frame is frozen per stage.**  It depends on the cell through that metric,
and the cell refines; recomputing it inside the residual would make the DOF-to-
component map a function of θ.  So it is built once from the stage's declared
cell — the same freeze the symmetry-operation subsets take — and the parameter
table and the forward model call this module with the *same* cell so there is
exactly one frame per site per stage.  A monoclinic β that moves during a stage
therefore shifts the frame at the next compile, which is where the components
written back at the end of a stage are re-projected.

**Dimension by dimension.**

===  ===================================  ==========================
n    DOFs                                 what the site allows
===  ===================================  ==========================
0    none                                 no moment at all
1    (μ,)                                 one direction, signed
2    (μ, φ)                               a plane
3    (μ, θ, φ)                            any direction
===  ===================================  ==========================

μ is signed for n = 1 — the sign is the only way to state that two independent
sites order antiparallel along the same axis, and there is no angle to carry it
— and unsigned by construction for n ≥ 2, where the antipode is an angle away.
Nothing bounds it either way; ``abs(μ)`` is the magnitude, and the floor that
decides whether the block is supported is on ``abs(μ)``
(:data:`~rietx.schemas.structure.MOMENT_FLOOR_MU_B`).
