    """Read the first data block of a CIF into a single-phase :class:`Structure`.

    Uses gemmi's small-molecule reader, which resolves the space group from
    the recorded H-M (or Hall) symbol and carries fractional coordinates,
    occupancies, and isotropic/equivalent displacement parameters.

    ``aniso=True`` keeps ``_atom_site_aniso_U_ij`` as an
    :class:`~rietx.schemas.structure.AnisoU` block on each site that has
    one, instead of collapsing it to U_eq.  It is opt-in for the same reason
    the schema field is: reading a file must not silently change which
    parameters a refinement plan will free.  Sites without an aniso loop keep
    their isotropic value either way, so a mixed file yields a mixed
    structure.

    Species are passed through :func:`normalize_cif_species`, so the two wild
    type-symbol forms (``"O1"``, ``"O-2"``) arrive refinable instead of
    failing at the first stage compile.  Pass ``diagnostics=`` a list to
    record what changed: each distinct rewritten form appends one
    ``CIF_SPECIES_NORMALISED`` diagnostic naming the substitution, with
    ``where`` carrying every affected atom path.

    A **bracketed** H-M label beside an operation loop is a phase carrying its
    own operation list (what :func:`write_structure_block` writes for one), and
    comes back as that list in the file's order under that label — never as
    whatever symbol gemmi finds for the operations, which would drop the label
    and reorder the list a symmetry code indexes.

    **A magCIF** — a file carrying ``_space_group_symop_magn_operation.xyz``
    and an ``_atom_site_moment`` loop, which is what MAGNDATA, ISODISTORT and
    k-SUBGROUPSMAG emit — arrives as WP-1327's model: the operator list with
    its time-reversal signs on ``Phase.magnetic_symmetry``, the moments in
    crystal-axis components on the sites they name, and the BNS/OG symbol as
    metadata.  The nuclear space group's type comes from
    ``_parent_space_group.name_H-M_alt``, because a magCIF has no ordinary
    ``_space_group_name_H-M_alt`` at all and gemmi therefore resolves no space
    group for one; its setting is checked against the file's own operators
    (:func:`~rietx.crystallography.magcif.resolve_nuclear_symmetry`).  Two magnetic constructs are **refused by name** rather than
    half-read: a modulated structure (any ``_atom_site_moment_Fourier`` or
    special-function loop) and a structure stated in a *supercell* of its
    parent (the generic commensurate k ≠ 0 record) — see
    :mod:`rietx.crystallography.magcif`, which owns the vocabulary and both
    refusals.

    ``moment_ions`` and ``moment_g`` state, per site label, the two quantities
    no magnetic dictionary carries: the ion whose form factor the moment
    scatters with (``{"Mn1": "Mn3+"}``) and the Landé g a 4f moment needs.
    Where ``moment_ions`` says nothing the site's own type symbol is used and a
    ``CIF_MAGNETIC_ION_UNCHARGED`` diagnostic reports it, because MAGNDATA
    writes a bare ``Mn`` for a site that is chemically Mn³⁺ and the two form
    factors differ.  A key of either that names no ``_atom_site_moment`` row is
    refused (:class:`~rietx.crystallography.magcif.MagCifError`), since a
    misspelled label would leave its site on that default in silence.

    ``nuclear_group`` chooses which group a magCIF's atom *positions* refine
    under (the moments always refine under the file's magnetic group).
    ``"auto"`` takes the highest tabulated group the file's atoms satisfy — the
    parent where it contains the file's operators and keeps every site's
    orbit, reported by ``CIF_MAGNETIC_NUCLEAR_GROUP``, else the file's own
    family group, reported by ``CIF_MAGNETIC_NUCLEAR_SETTING`` (issue #457) —
    in its tabulated setting, or, where no tabulated setting has exactly its
    operations, as its own operation list under a bracketed label
    (``Phase.symmetry_operations``); ``"file"`` always takes the file's own group; ``"parent"`` always takes the
    parent and raises by name where it cannot carry the file's atoms.  It acts
    where the nuclear group is derived from ``_parent_space_group``, and a file
    with no magnetic block ignores it
    (:func:`~rietx.crystallography.magcif.resolve_nuclear_symmetry`).
