"""Bound coherent neutron scattering lengths.

The neutron analogue of :mod:`rietx.crystallography.scattering`, and the
difference between them is the whole point: an X-ray form factor f(Q) falls off
with angle because the electron cloud has spatial extent, while a nucleus is a
point scatterer on this scale, so **b is independent of Q**. One number per
species, not a five-Gaussian expansion.

Source: Sears, V. F. (1992). *Neutron News* **3**(3), 26–37; and the same
author's tabulation in *International Tables for Crystallography* Vol. C,
ch. 4.4.4, Table 4.4.4.1 — the crystallographic reference of record, and the
volume this package already relies on for dispersion (§4.2.6), flat-plate
absorption (Table 6.3.3.1) and the Lorentz-polarisation factor (§6.2).

Three properties have no X-ray counterpart and each one breaks an assumption
the X-ray path is entitled to make:

* **b can be negative** — H, Li, Ti, V, Mn among the natural-abundance
  elements. It is a 180° phase shift on scattering, not an error state. |F|²
  stays positive; individual terms in the sum do not, so anything that takes
  ``abs()`` or ``sqrt()`` of a single species' amplitude is wrong here.
* **b depends on isotope, not just element** — b(¹H) = −3.7406 fm against
  b(²H) = +6.671 fm is a sign change. That is why deuteration is routine, and
  why this lookup resolves an isotope to *its own* row rather than to the
  element. It is the opposite of the convention in
  :func:`rietx.crystallography.dispersion.normalize_element`, where an ion
  resolves to its element because f′/f″ is a core-level effect: there, the
  element is the identity; here, the isotope is.
* **The table is thermal** — no energy dependence. For the resonant absorbers
  (Cd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and notably ¹¹³Cd, ¹⁵⁷Gd) b is complex and varies with
  wavelength near a resonance, the neutron analogue of an X-ray edge. At one
  constant wavelength a single thermal value is the right number. A
  time-of-flight bank spans a range of wavelengths and would need b(λ), which
  this table cannot give — recorded here because that is a fence, not an
  oversight.
