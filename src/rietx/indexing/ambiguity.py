"""Geometrical ambiguity — enumerated and **reported, never resolved**.

A powder pattern carries only the *length* of each reciprocal vector, so distinct
lattices can produce calculated patterns with identical line positions (Mighell,
A. D. & Santoro, A. (1975), *J. Appl. Cryst.* **8**, 372-374).  No amount of
counting statistics separates them: the information is absent from the
measurement, not buried in noise.  This module therefore does three things and
stops.

1. **Enumerate** the derivative lattices of index 2-4 exactly, as integer
   matrices in Hermite normal form.  The closed sets have 7, 13 and 35 members —
   which is a *self-check*, not a comment: :func:`hnf_matrices` reproduces those
   counts in ``tests/test_indexing_reduce.py``, so an enumeration bug shows up as
   a count mismatch rather than as a silently missing partner.
2. **Test** each against the observed lines, and keep only those that explain
   them as well as the parent does.  A derivative lattice that predicts extra
   lines *where lines were observed to be absent* is excluded by the data; one
   whose extra lines fall outside the measured range, or wherever nothing was
   looked for, is not — and that distinction is the whole content of the report.
3. **Say what would break the tie.**  ``discriminating_reflections`` carries the
   hkl and the 2θ where the partner and the parent differ, so the report is
   actionable rather than merely honest — the structural twin of Layer 2's
   "extend the fit range".

A setting change is *not* an ambiguity: derivative lattices that Niggli-reduce to
the parent are dropped, which is what keeps this question distinct from dedup
(``reduce.same_lattice``).

**Step 2's exclusion was stated here from the start and not implemented until
WP-1024, and the gap was not cosmetic.**  A superlattice's reciprocal lattice
strictly *contains* the parent's, so it indexes every observed line exactly and
ties the parent on every forward-looking figure — which meant the original screen
(compare ``n_indexed``, compare the mean discrepancy) reported **every** derivative
lattice as a partner: measured, 28 partners for a certified cubic cell on exact
synthetic positions, 20-35 across systems.  The consequence is one rank up: WP-1024's
confidence gate refuses ``high`` to any candidate with an ambiguity partner, so the
indexer could never have answered at all.  And the answer was already in the
docstring — a doubled cubic cell predicts lines at half the parent's d-spacings,
those lines are *not there*, and their absence is data.  ``predicted_seen_fraction``
exists one module over for exactly this reason; this is the same measurement asked
about one lattice instead of a ranking.

The exclusion is **asymmetric on purpose** and the asymmetry is what makes it
sound: it tests the partner's *extra* predictions, never the parent's own absent
ones.  A correct lattice routinely predicts reflections nothing is observed at
(space-group extinctions, not yet determined while indexing runs, and lines too weak to
detect — the truth showed 56.5 % of its own predicted lines in this repo's §D
data), so a symmetric rule would exclude the truth first.  What the data can rule
out is a line a *rival* lattice needs and the parent does not.

**Why excluding a supercell is crystallography and not convenience.**  A 2a cell
whose odd reflections are *identically* zero is not a lattice statement at all: a
structure with no superlattice intensity has the a-translation, so the lattice
*is* the a-lattice and the 2a cell is a cell choice.  Indexing determines the
lattice, so the small cell is the answer and the supercell is not a rival
hypothesis about it.  What this exclusion genuinely gets wrong is the *weak*
case — a partially-ordered superstructure whose superlattice reflections are
non-zero but below the peak picker's detection floor.  That case is not lost,
it moves: the whole-profile Le Bail validation (WP-1024's
``predicted_but_absent``) asks the same question of the **pattern** rather than of
the peak list, where a line an order below the detection threshold still shows,
and ``discriminating_reflections`` says where to count longer.  Read a partner
list, therefore, as "positions alone cannot separate these", never as "no
supercell is possible".

    p-value :meth:`SupercellEvidence.verdict` reads.

    **The extras are the ones no extinction can cancel.**  WP-1446 asked this
    question of the child's whole lattice, and it cannot be answered there.  A
    space-group extinction removes a correct cell's lines exactly as an
    oversized cell lacks them.  SRM 676a's own cell is an index-2 superlattice of
    a c/2 subcell the search returns beside it, and ``R -3 c``'s c-glide leaves
    most of its lattice extras absent, so the lattice count reads 9 of 34 seen
    at p₀ = 0.152 (p = 0.062) and would demote the certified cell.  Asking under
    the child's extinction class separates the two, but the screen's class moves
    with the 2θ range on every truth with extinctions measured (WP-1449).  So by
    default only :func:`uncancellable` reflections are counted, the ones no
    space group of the child's lattice can extinguish: 8 of 18 on corundum
    (p = 0.0029), the same count ``R - c -`` gives.  ``child_hkl`` overrides the
    list; the child's lattice reflections reproduce WP-1446's instrument.

    **The count is judged against chance, never against a bar.**  An extra is
    *seen* when it sits inside some observed line's window, ``k_sigma`` × σ(Q),
    and a position no line is at is seen at the rate p₀ :func:`chance_rate`
    measures over the same windows.  A phantom supercell's extras are seen at
    about p₀; a real superstructure's more often.  The one-sided binomial p is
    the chance of at least ``n_seen`` of ``n_extra`` at p₀.  Pass ``q_esd`` as the
    window the search matched with (``engines.match_window``): the question is
    whether a line would have been claimed as indexed.

    **What counts as an extra.**  A counted reflection whose parent coordinates
    are not integral (:func:`_parent_coordinates`), inside ``q_range``
    (default: the observed lines' own span), and farther than the median σ(Q)
    from every line of the parent's lattice — a prediction that close to a
    parent line is the same line as far as these data resolve
    (:func:`_extra_mask`).  The parent's lines are its **lattice**'s: a child
    line where the parent's lattice predicts one says nothing about the larger
    cell.  Reflections the child's centring forbids are dropped rather than
    trusted.

    Measured 2026-09-27 on ten finished acceptance searches (WP-1449's Context
    holds the table): the correct cells tested as a child read p = 0.0029
    (corundum), 0.0072 and 0.0012 (pseudo-tetragonal descriptions of LaB6),
    and every wrong child p ≥ 0.27.  EXPO's WRIP20 is the precedent for
    ordering on what extinctions can explain, scoring each cell under its most
    probable extinction symbol (Altomare, Cuocci, Moliterni & Rizzi (2019),
    *International Tables* Vol. H ch. 3.4, eq. 3.4.5); this asks the question
    before any symbol is known.
