""":func:`index_pattern` — the public entry point — and the whole-profile
validation it drives.

``index_pattern`` runs the engines, deduplicates their candidates as reduced
cells, enumerates geometrical ambiguities, validates the survivors by a Le Bail
fit, and gates confidence on **agreement**.  Its API cannot express a confident
wrong singleton: it returns an
:class:`~rietx.schemas.indexing.IndexingResult`, which has no ``.cell``, and the
only route to one cell is ``best_or_none()``.

The rest of this module is that validation step, and it exists because the
figure-of-merit panel is computed on ≤20 lines and is structurally blind to three
things the whole pattern sees — the third being the one no figure of merit can be
patched to see:

1. **lines beyond the panel** — a cell can index the first twenty and fail from
   twenty-one;
2. **impurity content** — observed peaks with nothing calculated near them;
3. **reflections predicted where there is no intensity** — the classic
   doubled/oversized-cell false positive.  M₂₀ penalises it only through its
   ``N_poss`` denominator, which is Oishi-Tomiyasu's (2013) critique of the de
   Wolff figure, and both source papers on autoindexing (Bergmann *et al.* 2004;
   Altomare *et al.* 2019) close on whole-profile validation for exactly this
   reason.

So validation is **mandatory, not an option**: with no pattern every candidate
caps at ``"medium"`` and ``INDEX_NOT_VALIDATED`` fires — the *result* abstains
rather than one field being quietly downgraded.

**The plan's detector for (3) was measured wrong, and the replacement is
measured.**  WP-1024's plan named Layer 0's ``unmatched_calc`` — its
strong-negative-residual count — as ``predicted_but_absent``.  It cannot serve,
and the reason is structural rather than a threshold: Le Bail extraction sets each
reflection's intensity from ``max(y_obs − y_bkg, 0)``, so a reflection predicted
where there is nothing is assigned ~nothing and produces **no negative residual
to detect**.  What the detector then finds is 5σ noise excursions that happen to
sit near a tick.  Measured on a synthetic LaB₆ pattern (Poisson noise, 15-145° 2θ
at 0.02°, the protocol ``tests/test_indexing_consensus.py`` pins),
``unmatched_calc`` fired on **17 of the certified cell's own 28 reflections** and
on 94 of a doubled cell's 153 — 61 % either way, so it does not separate them at
all.  :func:`absent_reflections` asks the question directly instead — is there net
intensity above the *fitted* background at this position? — and separates them
cleanly: 0 of 28 against 117 of 153.

**The two detectors and ``lebail_rwp`` catch different failures, which is why all
three are reported.**  Same measurement, four cells:

| candidate | Rwp | predicted_but_absent | unmatched_observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| truth | 0.216 | 0/28 | 0 |
| doubled cell | 0.379 | **117/153** | 0 |
| a·√5 supercell | 0.957 | 27/204 | 4 |
| metric 1 % off | 0.984 | 0/30 | **95** |

Read the table by column.  Rwp is decisive on a *wrong metric* (0.98 against 0.22)
and nearly silent on an *oversized* one (0.379 — well under twice the truth's, and
on real data a gap that size is inside the spread between specimens); the oversized
cell is caught only by column three.  A wrong metric is caught from the other side
by column four, where 95 observed peaks have no calculated reflection.  The a·√5
row is the useful reminder that these overlap: its fit is already refuted by Rwp,
so its low absent *fraction* costs nothing — a badly-fitted background is what
makes that count unreliable, and a badly-fitted background comes with an Rwp that
says so.

``lebail_rwp`` is the figure the literature names; it is **not** a member of the
ranking panel.  The panel ranks every candidate and this costs a refinement, so
it is computed for the shortlist only — and ranking on it would reintroduce the
blind spot validation exists to close, since a bigger cell with more free
intensities fits better.

    has been determined.  A group carrying reflection conditions would hide
    exactly the reflections whose absence is not yet established, and hiding them
    is how an oversized cell passes: every phantom it predicts would be excused as
    an extinction.

    :class:`~rietx.schemas.results.RefinementResult` the fit produced, as
    ``(validation, result)`` — ``result`` is ``None`` when the fit raised, which
    is the state ``status="failed"`` describes.  It is **opt-in and not a field
    on** :class:`~rietx.schemas.indexing.LeBailValidation` for the reason
    history nodes store state rather than curves: the validation object is a
    JSON-round-tripped schema of a few hundred bytes, and a result carries
    y_obs/y_calc/y_background over every channel.  So the caller who wants a
    picture asks for one, and every caller who wants a verdict is unaffected —
    ``index_pattern`` among them, which stores the verdict on the candidate.

    **What the validation asks is discrete, and it is not this fit's Rwp.**  A
    cell is a hypothesis about *where lines can be* and about nothing else, so
    the question is a counting one: is there a reflection under every observed
    peak, and is there intensity under every predicted reflection.  Those are the
    two counts returned here (``unmatched_observed``, ``predicted_but_absent``).
    The fit exists to place the reflections over the whole profile and to give
    those counts a fitted background and width law to be counted against — a
    candidate that makes sense fits many peaks at once, and one that does not
    leaves the mismatch somewhere the counts can see it.

    **Structure-free because at indexing time there is no structure**, so the
    per-hkl intensities have to be free: a Rietveld validation would test the
    lattice and a structure hypothesis at once and could refute a right cell for
    a wrong structure.  That freedom is the point *and* the limit — free
    intensities carry no information about the cell, so ``rwp`` is reported for a
    reader and is **not evidence on its own**.  WP-1020 said the same thing when
    it kept ``lebail_rwp`` out of the FoM panel: the statistic *rewards
    flexibility*, and a cell predicting more reflections has more of it.  Reading
    a fit statistic as the evidence for a correction is the habit CLAUDE.md's
    "never an Rwp comparison as its evidence" rule exists to break.

    **Le Bail rather than Pawley is a cost choice, not a discrimination one.**
    Both extractions leave one free intensity per reflection, and the intensities
    are arbitrary in both: this partition hands overlapping reflections whatever
    share of ``max(y_obs − y_bkg, 0)`` the current profile ratio asks for, which
    is no more constrained than a least-squares intensity is.  What it costs is
    nothing in θ, where Pawley appends a
    :class:`~rietx.model.forward.PawleyBlock` and its overlap restraints for
    every candidate validated.  (A previous revision argued the opposite — that
    Le Bail is the *constrained* fit and therefore the discriminating one — from
    a measured magnetite Rwp pair.  The numbers were real, the mechanism was not
    established, and it contradicted both this module's own detector and
    WP-1020's panel decision; WP-1043 carries the retraction.)

    Single-phase by construction, and that is a measured constraint rather than a
    simplification: ``CompiledModel.lebail_update`` partitions
    ``max(y_obs − y_bkg, 0)`` per phase with nothing to arbitrate two phases
    claiming the same channel, so two phases inflate one another without bound
    (WP-1028, measured Rwp 742-9 281 % against 7.5-24.8 % for one phase, and it
    survives seeding both the widths and the background — so it is the partition,
    not the starting point).  A candidate is never validated against a
    multi-phase hypothesis.

    A fit that *raises* comes back as ``status="failed"`` with an infinite Rwp
    rather than as an exception: a candidate the physics refuses is evidence
    about the candidate, and the gate reads it as such (the ``validation_failed``
    caveat), where a traceback would abandon every other candidate with it.

    **Except a cancellation, which is evidence about nothing** (WP-1037).
    ``cancel`` may be the caller's token or ``index_pattern``'s whole-run
    :class:`~rietx.indexing.engines.Deadline`; either way the fit it stops is
    a fit that *ran out of time*, and letting ``RefinementCancelled`` fall into
    the generic handler would hand the gate a ``validation_failed`` — a
    **refuting** caveat — for a cell the run merely could not afford to check.
    So it re-raises, the caller stops the loop, and the candidate keeps
    ``lebail = None``, which reads as ``not_validated`` (capping): the honest
    state, and the same one an unreached candidate was always in.

    Give it a :class:`~rietx.schemas.indexing.PeakList`, or a ``data`` +
    ``instrument`` pair it will pick peaks from.  Supplying ``data`` is what turns
    whole-profile validation on: without a pattern every candidate caps at
    ``"medium"`` and ``INDEX_NOT_VALIDATED`` fires, because the figure-of-merit
    panel is blind to three things only the profile shows
    (:func:`validate_by_lebail`).

    ``engines`` names which searches to run, from the **live registry**
    (``engines.engine_names()``); the default is all of them, and that default is
    the one to keep — ``high`` confidence *means* every engine that ran found the
    same lattice, so restricting the list narrows what the answer can say.

    ``cancel`` is WP-1006's :class:`~rietx.optimize.cancel.CancelToken` and works
    here unchanged: the check is cooperative, read between units of search work, so
    it needs no stages, no Rwp and no history node.  A cancelled search returns
    what it has rather than raising — an indexing run has nothing to abandon,
    unlike a seeding refinement stage.

    ``spec.total_budget_seconds`` (WP-1037) is the whole-run ceiling — search,
    probe *and* validation, where ``budget_seconds`` is one (engine × system)
    slice.  It is enforced as a :class:`~rietx.indexing.engines.Deadline`,
    a clock shaped as a cancel token, so it nests under every cooperative
    check above with no engine changes and the run still returns a complete
    :class:`~rietx.schemas.indexing.IndexingResult` over what was reached.
    ``systems_searched`` then distinguishes three states — a system searched to
    completion (``search_complete`` true), one truncated mid-search (false),
    and one never reached (absent) — and ``INDEX_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`` names them.
    ``estimate_ceiling`` is the pre-run arithmetic for choosing the value.

    ``preset`` names a row of ``engines.SEARCH_PRESETS`` and defaults to
    ``"quick"`` (WP-1042): all engines, all requested systems, and a whole-run
    ceiling of ``QUICK_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS`` filled into
    ``spec.total_budget_seconds`` **only when the caller left it None** — a
    declared spec field is never overridden, the same rule as
    :func:`_adopt_measured_shift`.  ``preset="full"`` is the pre-1.0
    behaviour: no ceiling beyond ``budget_seconds`` per (engine × system).
    The result records which preset governed (``IndexingResult.preset`` —
    ``"custom"`` when the caller's own ceiling did), and under a declared
    ceiling each validation fit draws an equal **slice** of the remaining
    clock, so one heavy candidate cannot starve the rest of the shortlist
    (measured: unbudgeted fits were 74 of fap's 84 s).

    **The (engine × system) units run system-major** (WP-1042): every engine
    finishes one system before any engine starts the next, in ``SYSTEM_ORDER``
    (cheapest metric first).  A binding deadline therefore sacrifices trailing
    systems for every engine *equally* — a completed system holds all engines'
    answers, which is what the agreement gate needs — where the engine-major
    loop this replaced truncated whole engines, so which candidates kept their
    finders depended on which engine the clock happened to catch.

    **Abstention is checked before any budget is spent, and it is about
    searchability, not scorability** (WP-1043).  A peak list that cannot support
    a search *in any system* (``MIN_LINES_PER_DOF``) comes back with the
    candidates empty and ``INDEX_DATA_INSUFFICIENT`` from the quality gate,
    never as an exception and never as a ranked list with nothing behind it.  A
    list that is merely short of the twenty lines the classical figures of
    merit are defined on is **searched anyway**, over the supported systems
    only (:func:`_restrict_to_supported`), ranked by the reduced panel, and
    capped by the ``fom_panel_reduced`` caveat — each absent figure named with
    its reason on ``quality.fom_undefined``.
