"""Cooperative cancellation of a running refinement.

A fit is a python loop calling numpy; there is no safe way to interrupt one
from outside, and there is no need for one.  :class:`CancelToken` is a flag the
caller sets from another thread (the GUI server holds one per session and POST
``/api/cancel`` sets it), and the solver reads it **at eval boundaries** — in
between two residual evaluations, where the compiled model is quiescent.  That
is what keeps frozen-per-stage discreteness intact: nothing reaches into the
compiled state, and the stage simply stops being asked for more evaluations.

The token is deliberately dumb — set it, read it — so that mapping an HTTP
route onto it is one line and no lifecycle can go wrong.  Everything about
*what a cancelled run leaves behind* lives on the exception instead:

* the in-flight stage is **abandoned** — no history node, the parameter table
  is not committed, and the structure/instrument are restored to their
  pre-stage values (a stage that seeds — extinction's softplus lift, the
  Stephens isotropic ray — writes to the models before solving, and leaving
  that seed behind would be a stage that half-ran);
* :attr:`RefinementCancelled.completed_stages` and
  :attr:`RefinementCancelled.node_id` say where the working state *does* stand:
  at the last completed node, which is exactly a checkout target.

Timeouts and watchdogs are not here on purpose: they compose from the token
(``threading.Timer(30, token.cancel)``) and each caller wants a different
policy.
