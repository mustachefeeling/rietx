"""Parameter-space identifiability evidence off the final Jacobian (WP-1056).

Three measurements screened at fit time onto
:class:`~rietx.schemas.results.Identifiability` (the Jacobian is never
serialized, so anything read off it is measured here or lost):

* :func:`top_correlations` — the worst |ρ| pairs with their paths, from the
  same correlation matrix the ``HIGH_CORRELATION`` guard reads, in the same
  ``check_guards`` call, so a fired guard and the quoted evidence can never
  disagree.
* :func:`soft_modes` — the softest eigenvectors of the unit-column normal
  matrix, the object Watkin (2008, J. Appl. Cryst. 41, 491, §3.8) shows the
  pairwise table cannot see.  The covariance these describe is **undamped**:
  both drivers evaluate the returned Jacobian at the accepted solution, never
  inside a damped step (Watkin's Marquardt-λ caveat; asserted by test against
  a fresh evaluation at ``outcome.theta``).
* :func:`exchangeability_scan` — for each *held* candidate in
  :data:`EXCHANGE_CANDIDATE_GLOBS`, the block projection R² of its column
  onto the fitted span, with the partner loadings that name who absorbs it.
  Prince (*Mathematical Techniques in Crystallography and Materials Science*,
  3rd ed., ch. 8) is the textbook statement of why the fitted state cannot
  show this by itself: omitting a correlated variable leaves no bias, only
  survivor esds whose "apparent precision will be illusory".

**The measured fact that shapes the whole design** (spike, 2026-08-12, WP-1056
handover): projection R² is a property of the design matrix over the sampled
range, *not* of the fit.  On the E2 fixture (planted −0.02 mm displacement,
never freed, absorbed by a compensating zero_shift at 128 σ) and on its clean
reference (zero_shift at 1.6 σ from 0) the held-displacement R² is 0.999945
on **both**.  So this module reports numbers only; the two-condition
discriminator — R² high *and* a partner significantly away from its null —
is applied where the nulls are known, in :mod:`rietx.report`.

The scan's extra cost is one Jacobian evaluation at the converged point
(candidates freed all at once, never one at a time), on the numpy reference
path whatever backend ran the fit — an evaluate-only measurement, and the
conformance matrix pins the backends to per-column agreement anyway.
