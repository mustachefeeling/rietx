"""Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) from refined Rietveld scales.

Weight fractions follow the scale-factor relation of Hill & Howard (1987),
J. Appl. Cryst. 20, 467 (see also Bish & Howard 1988, J. Appl. Cryst. 21, 86):
for phase ``p`` with refined scale ``S_p``,

    W_p = S_p·(Z·M·V)_p / Σ_q S_q·(Z·M·V)_q

with Z the formula units per cell, M the formula mass, V the cell volume.  All
three are derived from the refined model — the point of this package is to
remove the GUI-era ritual of typing Z·M·V by hand.  Occupancies enter the mass
(a partly-occupied site weighs less), so the cell mass Z·M is computed from the
*refined* occupancies, not a formula string.

The load-bearing, unambiguous quantity is the **cell mass** Z·M =
Σ_atoms occ·multiplicity·atomic_weight; the Z/M split is a display convenience
recovered by reducing the cell composition to integer formula units, and QPA
never depends on it (weight fractions use Z·M·V directly).

Scope: these are fractions of the **modelled crystalline** content.  An
unmodelled amorphous fraction or a missing phase still makes them sum to 1.
Internal-standard / amorphous quantification is fenced to v2 — that is
O'Connor & Raven (1988), Powder Diffr. 3, 2, whose calibration constant
is what ``K`` means in this field, which is why nothing here spells a
Z·M·V with that letter.

    interval straddles an absorption edge, refuse outside 2-120 keV, and have
