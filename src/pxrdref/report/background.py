"""FitReport background evidence — the two failure modes nothing else shows.

Layer-0 in trustworthiness: everything here is measured on the arrays the
result already carries, plus the one number that could not be (the block
projection R², screened at fit time onto
:class:`~pxrdref.schemas.results.Identifiability` because the Jacobian is
never serialized).  Nothing is linearised, so the section speaks on an
abstained report too — and it must, since an over-flexible background is a
*cause* of a bad fit at least as often as a symptom.

The contract, the reading and the citations are the
:class:`~pxrdref.report.schemas.BackgroundEvidence` docstring; this module is
how the numbers are computed and where their measured separations are
recorded.

    full segmentation it computed, not with ``report.regions``.
