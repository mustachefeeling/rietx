"""From a typed suggestion to the verbs that carry it out (WP-1012).

:mod:`.layer2` says *what* is worth doing, in a closed vocabulary pinned by
``THRESHOLDS_VERSION``.  This module says *how* — and the two halves are
deliberately separate files, because they version differently: the vocabulary is
a contract an agent reads, while the mapping onto verbs is a property of what
this build can actually do and changes when a verb *arrives* (indexing is the
live example: ``reindex_or_recheck_cell`` has been emitted since v0.2 with
nothing behind it).

Three rules.

**An applicable action is one stage.**  :func:`stage_for` returns a
:class:`~pxrdref.schemas.plan.StageSpec` and executes nothing, so applying a
suggestion travels the path a "Run this stage" button already travels — the same
``run_stage``, the same refusal while a run is in flight (frozen-per-stage
discreteness), the same event stream, the same one history node.  That is also
what makes *undo* a ``checkout`` of the previous head rather than an inverse verb
nobody wrote.

**The action's own ``parameter_paths`` are the globs.**  :data:`RECIPES` declares
only *how* a kind can be carried out, never *which* paths: Layer 2 wrote them,
sometimes with a phase index in them (texture), and a second copy here could
disagree with the rationale printed beside it.

**Not every kind is a button, and each non-button says why in its own terms.**
Four of the sixteen are advice, and none of them for want of effort:

* ``add_impurity_phase`` — nothing is named yet, so there is nothing to free.
  Identifying the phase is the work, and adding it is an ``edit_model``.
* ``collect_better_data`` — there is no verb; the fit is saying the pattern is
  the limit.
* ``increase_background_flexibility`` / ``decrease_background_flexibility`` —
  these change what the background can *absorb* rather than which parameters
  move.  A Chebyshev term, a knot spacing or a ``lambda_smooth`` is a property
  of the model, not a member of ``turn_on``, so there is no glob a stage could
  carry and the edit is an ``edit_model`` move.  What changed in WP-1055 is the
  *evidence*, not the kind: a more flexible background lowers Rwp while biasing
  ADPs up and scales (hence QPA fractions) down, and until then the statistic
  that detects it — the block projection R² of
  :func:`~pxrdref.optimize.statistics.background_absorption` — reached a caller
  only as the ``BACKGROUND_ABSORPTION`` diagnostic, so these notes could name
  an edit whose effect the report could not show.  It is now
  ``FitReport.background``, which is also what finally gave both kinds an
  emitter (:func:`~pxrdref.report.layer2.background_actions`); before that they
  were advice with nothing to travel on.

and one — ``reindex_or_recheck_cell`` — is gated on a flag a client can watch:
``capabilities().features["indexing"]``.  The design held up half-way: nothing
here needed editing when the engine landed (WP-1024), but the flag it watches
was mis-derived (``hasattr(pr, "index")`` against an export named
``index_pattern``), so the refusal outlived the engine until WP-1037 fixed the
name.  The gate still runs off the flag a caller passes, so a client talking to
a build that reports no engine still gets the refusal with its reason.

    * **Absent** — no parameter matches the glob at all.
      ``refine_preferred_orientation`` is the designed case:

      declares the block, and Layer 2 emits the action anyway on purpose (its

      a corner: a Debye-Scherrer instrument locks ``sample_displacement`` and

      Bragg-Brentano, where the aberrations have no meaning), while Layer 2's
