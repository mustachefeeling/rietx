"""Bruker ``.brml`` — the zip container DIFFRAC.MEASUREMENT writes.

Spec: a zip of XML, read off two real files.  Member paths, element names and
attribute names are interface facts, so they are written down here and the
parser below is this package's own::

    Experiment0/DataContainer.xml       the manifest
      <RawDataReferenceList>
        <string>Experiment0/RawData0.xml</string>   one per scan
    Experiment0/RawData0.xml
      <DataRoutes><DataRoute RouteFlag="Measured">
        <ScanInformation ScanName="TwoThetaOmegaScan">
          <ScanAxes><ScanAxisInfo AxisId="TwoTheta" …
        <Datum>1,1,44,18.028,-0.12937,0,2.63482,3</Datum>   … one per point
        <DataViews>
          <RawDataView xsi:type="FixedRawDataView"    Start="0" Length="1"
                       LogicName="MeasuredTime" />
          <RawDataView xsi:type="FixedRawDataView"    Start="1" Length="1"
                       LogicName="AbsorptionFactor" />
          <RawDataView xsi:type="VaryingRawDataView"  Start="2" Length="2">
            <Varying><FieldDefinitions FieldName="TwoTheta" AxisId="TwoTheta" />
                     <FieldDefinitions FieldName="Theta"    AxisId="Theta" />
          <RawDataView xsi:type="RecordedRawDataView" Start="7" Length="1">
            <Recording><Unit Base="Counts" />

**Every column is located from ``DataViews``, never counted.**  GSAS-II reads a
datum's ``[2]`` and ``[4]``; in the two real files here the 2θ sits at 2 and the
intensity at **7**, so a fixed index is a coincidence of one layout.  ``Start``
and ``Length`` say where each channel is and ``FieldDefinitions`` names the axes
inside a varying one, in order — which is a complete description, so this reader
uses it and asserts nothing about position.

**A ``RecordedRawDataView`` of ``Length > 1`` is a detector frame and is
refused.**  ``EJZ060_13_004_RSM.brml`` records 1280 channels per row from a
position-sensitive detector, with 1281×3 reciprocal-space coordinates beside
them; its ``ScanAxes`` still claims ``AxisId="TwoTheta"``, so the axis check
passes and only the recorded view's own length says what the rows are.  Reading
one channel of it, or the row as a profile, would both be inventions.

**The absorber is *already applied* to the stored intensity, which is the third
answer this WP has got from three vendors.**  ``AbsorptionFactor`` is a per-point
channel and it varies in the real file — 1.0 outside a strong substrate peak,
8.3 across 29 points of it.  Measured there: ``y`` is not integral, ``y × a`` is
not integral, and ``y / a`` **is**, exactly; and the stored series runs
continuously across the transition (120757 → 151306 → 182114 → 213600.5) while
``y / a`` steps by a factor of seven.  So Bruker stores the corrected intensity
and records the factor it used.  Nothing is multiplied here — but σ still has to
go back through it, because the Poisson quantity is ``y / a``: σ = √(y/a)·a,
which is :func:`base.sigma_from_scaled` at that scale.

Compare ``.xrdml``, where the *same* structural test says the opposite (the raw
series dips at the attenuated point, so the factor must be applied), and the two
Rigaku formats, where no obtainable file has a varying factor and the reader
therefore reports rather than decides.  Three formats, three answers, each
measured on a file rather than taken from a convention.
