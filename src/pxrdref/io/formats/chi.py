"""FIT2D / pyFAI ``.chi`` — an azimuthally integrated synchrotron pattern.

Spec: Hammersley (1997/2016), *FIT2D: An Introduction and Overview*, ESRF
Internal Report ESRF97HA02T, § "CHI file format"; the same four-line header is
what pyFAI's ``save1D``/``AzimuthalIntegrator.integrate1d`` writes.

    line 1   title, usually the source image's filename
    line 2   the **x-axis label** — and this is the whole difficulty
    line 3   the y-axis label
    line 4   ``<npoints>`` optionally followed by ``<ndatasets>``
    line 5…  the points, ``x y`` (some writers add a third σ column)

Two things about this format cost more than parsing it.

**Line 4 is why it needs a reader of its own.**  ``2000 1`` is a perfectly good
pair of floats, so the ASCII-column fallback appends it as a data point at
x = 2000, y = 1 — a phantom peak-free point far outside the pattern, which
survives every plot and quietly widens the fitted range.

**The x axis may not be 2θ at all.**  Integration output is written on 2θ, on q
or on d, and the file says which only in prose that no one standardised.
Reading a q axis as 2θ produces a confident wrong cell from values that parse
perfectly, so a recognisably non-2θ axis is **refused** rather than converted:
the conversion needs a wavelength this reader has not been given, and inventing
one is the failure this package exists to avoid.
