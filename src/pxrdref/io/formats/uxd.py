"""Bruker/Siemens ``.uxd`` — the DIFFRAC-AT ASCII export.

Spec: the format is line-oriented ASCII and its structure was read off five real
files (see ``tests/data/README.md`` for which, and why none could be vendored).
Keys and markers are interface facts, so they are written down here and the
parser is this package's own::

    ; a comment, anywhere
    _FILEVERSION=2                    required first non-comment line
    _ANODE='Cu'                       … file-level header
    _WL1=1.540600
    _GONIOMETER_RADIUS=250.000000
    ; (Data for Range number 1)
    _DRIVE='COUPLED'                  … per-range header, overriding the above
    _STEPTIME=1.000000                seconds per step, directly
    _STEPSIZE=0.020000
    _START=5.000000
    _2THETACOUNTS                     the block marker — see below
       5.0000      1234
       5.0200      1250

**The block marker declares two orthogonal things**, and its name is read as
those two rather than looked up in a table of four:

* the ``_2THETA`` prefix means **the first column is present**; without it the
  positions are reconstructed from ``_START`` and ``_STEPSIZE``;
* the ``COUNTS``/``CPS`` suffix is the **intensity unit**.

So ``σ`` needs no arithmetic detective work here, unlike ``.ras`` one module
over: that format declares its unit in a free-text header field which real files
get *wrong*, whereas this one declares it structurally, in the token that opens
the block, where it cannot disagree with itself.  Measured on the real files:
every ``COUNTS`` block is integral to the last of 3774 points.

**The prefix is nonetheless a misnomer, and trusting it is the trap.**  The
first column is the position of whatever ``_DRIVE`` names — and a rocking curve
(``_DRIVE='THETA'``) and a pole figure (``_DRIVE='PHI'``) are both stored under
a marker called ``_2THETACOUNTS``.  Of the five real files read, **four** are
not 2θ scans at all.  So ``_DRIVE`` is the authority and the same three-way
policy as ``.chi`` and ``.ras`` applies: recognisably 2θ reads, recognisably
something else is refused by name, unrecognised reads with a diagnostic.

**Ranges are scans, and this format is why the rule is not academic.**  One
153-range file carries ``_STEPTIME`` of both 2 s and 20 s; concatenating its
ranges would put measurements a factor of ten apart in counting statistics into
one weighting regime under one Poisson assumption.  ``scan=`` selects; nothing
joins.
