"""Q-space: the quadratic form, the symmetry-allowed metric subspaces, and
weighted candidate refinement.

**Q is linear in the metric, and that is load-bearing three times over.**  With
hkl assigned,

    Q = 1/d² = A h² + B k² + C l² + D kl + E hl + F hk,
    (A..F) = (G*₁₁, G*₂₂, G*₃₃, 2G*₂₃, 2G*₁₃, 2G*₁₂)

so fitting a cell to assigned lines is a **weighted linear** least-squares
problem; WP-1022's trial-and-error becomes an exact n×n solve; and WP-1021's
dichotomy bounds are attained at box corners, so it searches A..F rather than
(a, b, c, α, β, γ).  Neither d nor 2θ is linear in the metric — that is *why*
indexing works in Q.  *Source*: Altomare, Cuocci, Moliterni & Rizzi (2019),
International Tables for Crystallography Vol. H ch. 3.4, eq. (3.4.2).

**The symmetry-allowed subspace is derived, never tabulated.**  The allowed G*
patterns span ∩ker(A(R) − I) under A(R)[U] = R·U·Rᵀ, which is exactly
``crystallography.wyckoff.adp_basis`` — already exact-rational.  (Which R goes in
is subtle and the wrong choice is invisible in the dimension: see
:func:`metric_basis`.)  So a cubic search is genuinely one-dimensional and a
monoclinic one
four-dimensional, with no case table and no assumption about the setting: the
same code gives the right subspace for hexagonal axes, rhombohedral axes or a
non-standard monoclinic b-unique cell.  ``tests/test_indexing_core.py`` asserts
the derived subspace against ``crystallography.symmetry.cell_constraints`` — the
derivation must reproduce what the refinement side ties, and it asserts *which*
tie rather than how many, because the dimension agrees even when the subspace
does not (WP-1036, and :func:`metric_basis` one rank up).

Note the asymmetry with the refinement side: ``cell_constraints`` is keyed by
**setting** because a caller can hand it any symbol, while this module is keyed
by crystal *system* because a search has no symbol yet — only a lattice — and an
R lattice reaches indexing in hexagonal axes by construction (see
``indexing.extinction.compatible_groups``).

**esds are analytic, by the delta method.**  A..F comes out of a linear solve
with a covariance, and the cell is a smooth function of it, so ∂cell/∂(A..F) is
written out rather than finite-differenced — the analytic preference the whole
package follows.  The derivative that makes it easy is the matrix-inverse one,
dG = −G·dG*·G, since G = (G*)⁻¹.
