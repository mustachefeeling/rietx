"""Figures of merit — a **panel**, scored in both directions, never one number.

The measured reason this is a panel and not a scalar is in this repo's own prior
art (tag ``guillemot-study``, ``studies/guillemot/out/audit_full.txt`` §D).
Screening a pattern whose answer is known, a wrong phase **ranked first on share
of observed intensity indexed — 83.7 %, with 390 predicted lines of which 9.0 %
are present** — above the truth, which indexed 79.2 % while showing 56.5 % of its
own 23 lines.  A big cell indexes everything and means nothing.  So

* :func:`predicted_seen_fraction` is a **first-class ranking member**, not a
  post-hoc validation field, and
* the ranking is Borda over the whole panel rather than a sort on any member.

That is also Oishi-Tomiyasu's (2013) argument for reversing the asymmetry in the
de Wolff figure of merit, reached independently here on this repo's own data.

**Every FoM carries its blind spot, and the blind spot travels with the number.**
:class:`~pxrdref.schemas.indexing.FigureOfMerit` has a ``blind_spot`` field and it
is filled from the same string the docstring states, so a consumer cannot see a
value without seeing what it cannot see.  Three of them matter enough to state
here: M₂₀ counts *lattice*-possible lines, so it is blind to space-group
extinctions, and its ⟨ΔQ⟩ is a plain mean, so one impurity line wrecks it; F_N
lives in 2θ, where a refined zero shift can manufacture a large value; and
``indexed_fraction`` is the exact quantity §D above showed ranking a 390-line
impostor first.

    Higher is better, and ranking on this is ranking on the **product** of the
    members — a geometric mean up to a constant.

    **Why not Borda.**  A rank aggregation spends one whole point on a win of any
    size, so a near-tie and a rout are worth the same.  Measured on 11-BM NAC,
    that is not hypothetical: the primitive candidate beat the body-centred truth
    4 members to 3 while *taking* two of those members by 0.4 % and 0.01 % and
    *losing* ``m_rev`` by 516×, and Le Bail agreed with the loser.  A margin the
    panel measured in orders of magnitude was spent as one point, and three
    hairline margins outvoted it.

    **Why logs rather than a weighted sum.**  The panel mixes a ratio (M₂₀), an
    inverse-degrees quantity (F_N) and three fractions, so a plain sum is
    dominated by whichever member happens to carry the largest numbers, and
    fixing that needs weights there is no data to set.  Rescaling a member by
    ``c > 0`` shifts every candidate's log-sum by the same ``log c``, so the
    ordering does not depend on any member's units — the property that made
    ranks attractive — while the *size* of each win survives.

    What is given up is invariance to an arbitrary monotone reparametrisation of
    a member, which ranks do have.  That is the trade, not an oversight: a
    figure's magnitude is evidence, and a transform that changes ratios changes
    what the evidence says.

    Zero, negative and non-finite values floor at ``floor_rtol`` of the best
    candidate on that member, so a figure that could not be computed ranks worst
    rather than aborting the sum.  A member on which *every* candidate scores
    zero is silent and contributes nothing, rather than making every score
    ``-inf``.

    **This is not the ranking in use, and the measurement is why.**
    :func:`~pxrdref.indexing.engines.rank_candidates` still aggregates with
    :func:`borda_scores`.  Measured across six known-cell datasets (WP-1041), a
    plain log-sum ranks the truth first on **5 of 6** — exactly Borda's score,
    with a different failure: it fixes 11-BM NAC, where the truth wins ``m_rev``
    by 516×, and breaks certified corundum, where it promotes a half-volume
    subcell that indexes 43 of 55 lines against the truth's 51.

    The mechanism is general, so read it before reaching for this again: summing
    raw logs weights each member by its **dynamic range** across the candidate
    set, and the panel's ranges are not comparable — on corundum ``m_rev`` spans
    2.5→356 while the coverage fractions span 0.78→0.99, so one member is worth
    ten of another for no stated reason.  Standardising each member's logs cures
    that and **degenerates exactly where it is needed**: with two candidates every
    z-score is ±1 by construction, so NAC reverts to Borda's answer.  Down-
    weighting ``m_rev`` reaches 6 of 6 and the corpus brackets the weight only to
    ``0.034 < w < 0.294`` — two datasets setting one constant, which is the
    tuning the panel exists to avoid.  Kept, exported and tested because it is
    the instrument that measured all of this, not because it won.
