"""The project as text — one parser, on this side of the wire (WP-1009).

``.pxt`` is a line-oriented rendering of everything a session can edit: the
settings, the plan, and every parameter row with its vary flag.  It is a *view*,
not a file format anyone has to keep — the project is the ``.pxrd/`` directory —
and its purpose is the edit that a form cannot express: change forty vary flags
with a rectangular selection, read the whole model in one screen, diff two
protocols by eye.

**Why a DSL rather than TOML or YAML.**  Both would lose the aligned columns
that a rectangular selection exists to edit, and neither can say ``@`` — the one
mark this document needs most.  Neither speaks dot-paths in its errors either,
and a parse error that does not name a path is a parse error a user cannot act
on.

**The parser lives only here.**  The editor pane (WP-1013) gets a regex
highlighter and no grammar, so there is no second implementation to drift.

Three rules make the round trip safe:

**A delta is computed against the live project, never against the old text.**
``parse`` is pure syntax; ``changes`` compares the parsed document to the
``Refinement``'s own parameter rows and the ``ProjectDoc``'s own settings, and
emits only what differs.  So a document the user never touched produces *no*
verbs — which is the property that makes an editor pane safe to leave open — and
a field nobody can change is an error only when it actually differs.

**Everything is applied through the same public verbs a form uses**
(``set_values``, ``set_vary``, ``Project.set_excluded_regions``, the plan
setting), so a text apply lands in the history as the same nodes and reads in the
console as the same API calls.  All-or-nothing: ``set_values`` validates every
path before writing any, and it runs first, so a refusal leaves nothing applied.
Refusal *messages* are the verbs' own — a tied path is refused in the words
``set_values`` uses and a held row in the words ``ParameterRow.held_because``
uses, because two surfaces disagreeing about why a parameter cannot move is worse
than either one being terse.

**Values render at 12 significant digits, and an unedited line is not a change.**
A refined parameter carries more digits than that, so the document is lossy by
construction; what must not be lossy is *applying* it.  ``changes`` therefore
compares a typed number against the **rendered** current value rather than
against the stored one, so re-applying an untouched document is a no-op and only
digits a human actually typed reach the model.

What deliberately does not survive a re-render: **the user's own comments.**  The
document is regenerated from state on every read, and the only way to keep a
comment would be to store it — a second authority for something nothing else
needs.  Comments parse and are ignored; the annotations after each value are
rendered afresh each time.
