"""Layer-1 March-Dollase preferred-orientation diagnostic.

Per-region shape attribution (:mod:`.layer1`) sees *where* the intensities are
wrong; it cannot see the *hkl-direction* pattern that betrays texture, because a
March-Dollase bias is not a smooth function of 2θ — it depends on the angle
between each reflection and a preferred axis, which hops around with hkl.  This
module supplies that missing view: it extracts a per-reflection multiplicative
intensity correction from the residual (a Le Bail-style partition that
deconvolves overlaps by calculated share), then asks which single axis and
March coefficient r best reproduce those corrections.

The score is the fraction of the intensity-misfit "energy" that a March-Dollase
model on a given axis explains,

    R² = 1 − Σ_k w_k (f_k − P_k(r; a))² / Σ_k w_k (f_k − 1)²,

with f_k the extracted correction (f_k = 1 for a perfect fit), w_k the
reflection's calculated area (importance), and P_k(r; a) the orbit-averaged
March factor (:mod:`anatase.model.preferred_orientation`).  The denominator is
the misfit with **no** correction (r = 1 ⇒ P ≡ 1), so R² is exactly "how much of
what the intensities are getting wrong is explained by texture on this axis".

Deliberately independent of the maturity gate: strong uncorrected texture is a
*common cause* of an immature fit, so this diagnostic must still speak when
Layer 1 otherwise abstains.  It reports the axis; acting on it (freeing r on
that axis) is the strategy engine's decision.
