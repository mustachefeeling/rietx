"""Is this peak list fit to index — and what does it already say?

Both source papers on autoindexing conclude that *data quality* decides success:
"Lack of attention to data quality, even if followed by use of the most
efficient programs, will usually lead to failure" (Bergmann, Le Bail, Shirley &
Zlokazov, 2004).  This module is that sentence made executable.  It measures
what the list can support and **abstains** when it cannot, the same move Layer
1's global maturity gate makes one rank down, and for the same reason: a ranked
list of cells produced from data that cannot distinguish them is a confident
wrong answer, which is worse than no answer.

**What is knowable from a peak list alone, and what is not.**  This distinction
shaped the module and is worth stating before the code, because the WP's plan
did not resolve it.  Everything except the shift is a property of the list:

* the σ census, and σ(Q) against the mean line spacing — a *resolving power*;
* lines per metric degree of freedom, which is system-dependent, so "enough
  lines" is not one number;
* Smith's (1977) volume envelope from d at the N-th line;
* the **separability geometry** of the three shift templates over the 2θ range
  actually sampled — computable from the angles alone, before any shift is
  measured, which makes it a statement about the experiment rather than about
  the specimen.

The **cause** of a systematic shift is not knowable from the list on its own; the
**magnitude** is, and that division is WP-1038's correction to what this module
asserted before it.  The thesis it replaces — *"a shift is identifiable only
against a reference"* — was wrong, and wrong in the one place where it cost the
most: it is why ``best_or_none()`` was structurally ``None`` on every real
dataset, including the five that rank the truth first.

What makes the magnitude knowable with no cell is that a **harmonic reflection
pair** carries its own reference.  Two lines whose planes are integer multiples,
``(h'k'l') = m·(hkl)``, satisfy ``m·sin θ_B = sin θ'_B`` exactly, whatever the
lattice — so each such pair is one equation in the shift and none in the cell.
:mod:`anatase.indexing.pairs` is that measurement (Dong, Wu & Chen, 1999), and it
recovers corundum's −0.065° and SRM 660c's +0.037° from the peak list and nothing
else.  It is also honest about when it cannot: on a bare 20-line position list the
pair supply collapses to 1-7 and the method declines, which is exactly what Le
Bail (2004) §VII reports for the bethanechol entries.

So a shift reaches this module by three roads, and they are *named* rather than
merged (:data:`~anatase.schemas.indexing.TRUSTED_SHIFT_SOURCES` carries what they
share).  :func:`fit_shift_model` takes deviations against references a caller
supplied and reports ``source == "measured"``; :func:`assess_peak_list` with
``shift_from_pairs=True`` reports ``"reflection_pairs"``; and with neither it
still says ``"unavailable"`` rather than reporting a zero shift it never measured.
A search that wants a shift *dimension* rather than a magnitude still gets it from
WP-1020's ``refine_candidate``, where a cell exists.

**Dominant zone and dominant row are *not* here, and the reason is a
measurement.**  The WP's plan asserted both are "detectable in Q-space before any
search"; they are not, because neither is a summary statistic of a peak list.  A
dominant zone (one real axis much shorter than the others, Werner's short-axis
test) is the statement that the *low-angle lines satisfy a two-dimensional
quadratic form* — a 2-D indexing problem.  A dominant row (one axis much longer)
is an arithmetic progression k²B hiding among the low Q values — a 1-D one.  Each
is a search, not a census.  The obvious census — the most-repeated Q difference,
Ito's coincidence idea — was implemented and measured, and it separates neither:
at σ(Q) from a 0.002° peak list it scores dominant-zone cells (c = 3.1 and
2.7 Å) at +0.9σ and +0.8σ against a permutation null while scoring a *general*
monoclinic cell at +3.3σ.  What it actually detects is small-integer Q
commensurability — a cubic list scores +15.6σ against a uniform null, because
Q = A(h²+k²+l²) makes every difference a multiple of A.  So it was removed rather
than shipped as a diagnostic that fires on general cells and misses the cases it
names; the detection belongs in the engines (WP-1021/1022), where a candidate
zone exists to test.

**The shift model is the one genuine improvement over the programs the 2004
paper benchmarks**: they fit a single constant "zeropoint", while three distinct
physical causes produce three different angular dependences, and this package
already names all three (``report/layer2.py``'s ``_POSITION_ACTIONS``).  Both
bethanechol ICDD entries carry ~0.10° 2θ and the paper *hypothesises* specimen
displacement without a way to test it.  The templates are therefore fitted as
**nested single fits, never jointly**, restating Layer 1's measured reason: a
joint fit of collinear templates returned "a 0.02° zero-point error as a 1.8°
constant cancelled by a −1.8° cosθ" (``report/layer1.py``).

    N distinct lines above d_N), so it is a search bound and never a
    measurement.  At N = 20 the constant is 13.39.

    **It is a mean line and not an envelope, and callers using it as a ceiling
    must add their own slack.**  Checked against the paper (2026-07-30): Smith
    fits this by least squares to ~40 well-determined *triclinic* patterns and
    quotes an average discrepancy of 10.6 %, deviations from 32 % high to **29 %
    low**, and names the low side as the ordinary case — it is what missing weak
    lines produce.  With p the fraction of possible lines detected, this estimate
    stands in ratio 1.40·p to the truth, so it *excludes the true cell* below
    p = 0.71, and 1 − 0.71 is Smith's own worst case.  As a hard ceiling it
    therefore carries no margin against the worst pattern in its own calibration
    set.  :data:`VOLUME_ENVELOPE_SLACK` is what turns the mean line into an
    envelope, and since WP-1045 every engine's search ceiling applies it
    (:func:`~anatase.indexing.engines.search_volume_ceiling`); the function
    itself stays the raw estimate, because the report records what Smith's
    formula *measured* and the slack is its consumer's calibration.

    The paper is **triclinic-only and publishes no per-system factors**; the two
    scalings below are this package's derivation, and there is nothing in Smith
    to check them against.  Its own closing paragraph names systematic absences
    as the obstacle to extending the method to monoclinic and orthorhombic and
    leaves it unsolved.

    Scaled by **two** factors, because the published form is for a *primitive
    triclinic* lattice and the count Smith's derivation makes is of *distinct
    lines*:

    * the Laue orbit factor (:data:`_LAUE_ORBIT_FACTOR`) — a cubic lattice of the
      same volume shows ~24× fewer distinct lines, so the triclinic constant
      bounds a cubic search 24× too tightly;
    * the centring multiplicity (:data:`_MAX_CENTRING`) — measured while writing
      this: the triclinic-with-Laue-scaling form put corundum's envelope at
      125 Å³ against a true 255 Å³, i.e. it **excluded the right answer**,
      because R-centring extinguishes two thirds of hkl.

    Pass ``centring_multiplicity`` once an extinction symbol is known
    (:func:`anatase.indexing.extinction.determine_extinction_symbol`, whose
    leading class names the centring) to tighten the bound; the default is the
    loosest the system allows.
