"""WP-1127: does bounding the ladder's first rung change the answer?

Run: ``.venv/bin/python examples/bench_ladder_bound.py``

`examples/bench_refinement.py` already prices the bound — `trigger-series`
against `trigger-series-bounded`, `cpd-series` against `cpd-series-bounded`.
What it cannot say is whether the two chains **agree**, and that is the half
that decides whether the bound may ship: a cheaper chain that lands somewhere
else is not a faster chain, it is a different one.

So this script is the equivalence read-out, and it runs the WP's pre-registered
kill criterion clauses 2-4:

``escalations`` / ``quarantined`` / ``status``
    a bounded rung comes back ``"max_iter"``, which :func:`_better` reads as
    merely not-diverged and :func:`_reseed_needed` does not test at all — so a
    bound that did not force the next rung would let the ladder **accept** a
    truncated fit.  Clause 2 is the guard against exactly that, and it is
    checked on the entries rather than on the code.
``agreement``
    per-pattern worst ``|Δ|/esd`` against the unbounded arm, reported twice:
    over every path, and again with the trigger case's exactly degenerate width
    family dropped.  A bound that moves the split of one width without moving
    the sum has not moved the answer, which is why WP-1123 and WP-1124 both
    report it this way — and the second number is the one clause 3 is about.
``direction="both"``
    the read-out that retired WP-1124's predictors.  Both of its arms turned
    ``SEQUENTIAL_PATH_DEPENDENT`` from absent to reported, because a first-order
    predictor cannot seed the first two patterns of a pass and is therefore
    asymmetric in the series coordinate.  The bound has a weaker version of the
    same shape — the *first* warm pattern of a pass has no accepted first rung
    behind it, and which pattern that is depends on the direction — so the
    check is run rather than argued.

The comparison machinery is imported from ``bench_series_predictor`` (WP-1124)
rather than copied: ``_agreement``, the degenerate-family filter and the
escalation/quarantine/wasted-wall readers are the same measurements on the same
case, and a second copy would be a second authority for what "the answers
agree" means.  ``ArmRun``'s three predictor fields are passed as zeros here,
which is the one price of sharing it.

Wall clock is reported but never compared across runs: the arms of one table
run in one process, and the deterministic read-outs (nfev, njev, iterations)
lead every claim.  `bench_refinement.py` is the authority for the timings.
