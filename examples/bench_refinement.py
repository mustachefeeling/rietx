"""WP-1111: the v1.1 refinement benchmark harness.

Run: ``.venv/bin/python examples/bench_refinement.py``

One command prints the table the **v1.1 milestone is judged by** — named
cases, wall-clock ranges, evaluation counts, per-stage iterations — so every
later speed WP quotes *this* harness for its before/after instead of inventing
its own measurement.  Nothing here changes production code, and that is a
requirement rather than an accident: a harness that lands in the same commit as
an optimisation can no longer measure it.

Read these four rules before quoting any number this script prints.

1. **Wall clock is a range, never a figure** (CLAUDE.md § Commands).  Each case
   is run ``--repeats`` times (default 3) and the *min and max* are printed.  A
   single number would invite comparison against a remembered one, and machine
   state moves these further than most changes do: a concurrent ``pytest -n
   auto`` inflated a 1.24 s fit to 4.78 s — 3.9× — during WP-1109.  **Run this
   on an idle machine, alone.**
2. **Never compare across machines**, and never against a figure whose venv and
   platform are not stamped beside it.  This script stamps its own header with
   both, plus the package version and the numpy build, so a pasted table
   carries its own provenance.
3. **Rwp is an identity check, not the metric.**  It is printed so that two
   runs of the same case can be seen to be the *same fit*, and the repeats are
   compared for it; a speed change that moves Rwp is not a speed change.  The
   metric is wall clock, and the diagnostics are the evaluation counts.
4. **Every number carries its configuration.**  Since WP-1403 a fit records
   itself by default, so "the wall clock of ``cpd-2``" is no longer a complete
   statement — ``--configs`` says which fit was timed, every row prints its
   key, and a number quoted without one is ambiguous rather than merely
   imprecise.
5. **The counts come from scipy, the wall clock from this process.**  ``nfev``
   and ``njev`` are read off the ``OptimizeResult`` that
   ``rietx.optimize.least_squares`` gets back, by wrapping the module-level
   ``least_squares`` name for the duration of a run (see ``_counting``).  This
   is a measurement scaffold, not an API: the package records ``nfev`` per
   stage as ``StageResult.n_iterations`` and records ``njev`` nowhere, which is
   WP-1113's ground.  The wrapper costs one attribute read per solve and does
   not perturb the timing.

Cases
-----
The first three are the baselines WP-1109 ranked its candidates on, rebuilt
from the acceptance suites' own fixtures rather than from restated protocols —
so that when a number here disagrees with one there, the protocol is not among
the candidate explanations.

``nac-lebail`` 11-BM NAC, 1 phase, ``profile_only``, Le Bail mode, 22 003
             points.
``nac``      The Rietveld leg built on it: 2 phases, 6 stages, same points.  No
             FCJ (Debye-Scherrer at 0.414 Å), so windows are symmetric and the
             peak loop is dispatch-bound rather than node-bound.  Its Le Bail
             seed is built **once**, at setup, and is not timed.
             **WP-1109's 1.5-1.8 s NAC row is the two legs together** — split
             here because timing only the Rietveld leg against that row shows a
             2.4× discrepancy that is not a speed change.
``cpd-1a``   IUCr CPD round-robin sample 1a, 3 phases, Cu Kα doublet,
             ``qpa_plan`` (8 stages), 7 251 points.  **FCJ physics is off at
             every stage**, despite the lab optics: ``qarr_instrument``
             leaves both axial ratios at 0.0 and the plan frees only
             ``axial_sl``, and the aberration needs both positive.  Stages
             before ``lines_axial`` compile no quadrature node; from it on,
             cumulative freeing plus ``AXIAL_SIZING_FLOOR`` allocate nodes
             that evaluate as one-hot symmetric fallbacks — overhead, not
             asymmetry (measured by WP-1112's gate, which corrected this
             blurb).  The small-cell lab case; the FCJ case is ``trigger``.
``cpd-2``    The same instrument on sample 2 under the **QPA acceptance
             protocol** — 4 phases, 9 stages with texture — i.e.
             ``test_sample2_brucite_march_dollase``'s own fit.  This is the
             case WP-1109 profiled at 534 residual + 425 Jacobian evaluations,
             and it is *not* the same fit as the 4-phase ``mccusker_default``
             row in that WP's opening table.  Quote them separately.

The last two are the shape none of the shipped baselines covers, and they are
**simulated**: see the block comment above ``_TRIGGER_TT`` for exactly which
parts are literature and which are invented, and why nothing they print is a
structural claim.

``trigger``  4 phases with large low-symmetry cells, Cu Kα doublet + FCJ,
             4 165 points, 1 188 (line, reflection) pairs — an order of
             magnitude more peaks than the baselines above, fitted cold.
``trigger-series`` and ``trigger-series-stages``
             Ten copies of it with a 100 ppm/step cell ramp through
             ``refine_sequential``: one cold fit then nine warm starts, which
             is the workflow the milestone's ~1 s/pattern target names.  Both
             ``refit`` rungs are measured — see ``_trigger_series`` for why
             the saving one of them is quoted for was never measured at this
             width.

Runtime: the whole harness at the default three repeats is ~35 minutes, nearly
all of it the last three cases.  ``--cases`` selects; ``--list`` shows the
keys.

Configurations
--------------
WP-1404 added a second axis, and it exists because WP-1403 made **recording the
default**: every ``fit()`` in the wild now writes a run directory unless it is
declined, so an unconfigured bench run measures a *recorded* fit and would
silently re-baseline every number this harness has ever printed.  ``--configs``
is therefore explicit and defaults to ``off``, which is what the rows above
were measured under.

``off``          ``telemetry=False`` — no recorder, no events.  **The control**,
                 and the row every ratio is against.
``no-eval``      the recorder with its ``eval`` stream suppressed.  **A harness
                 scaffold, not a knob the package has**: it drops the line *and*
                 stubs out the decode that builds it, so what it prices is the
                 ceiling of WP-1403's mitigations 2 and 3 — the most a sink-side
                 thrift could ever buy.  Never quote it as a thing rietx does.
``record``       the shipping default: recorder attached at ``telemetry=<dir>``,
                 ``eval`` lines buffered, cancel token attached.  WP-1404's
                 original configurations 2 and 3 are this one row, WP-1405
                 having made the token unconditional; it priced the token itself
                 at 1.0036× by interleaving arms of one fit, which is a finer
                 instrument than this matrix.
``events-path``  ``events=<path>``, no recorder — WP-1401 measured this at
                 1.01-1.03×, so it is the bridge that says whether two sittings
                 are comparable at all.
``live``         ``events=LiveSession(dir)``, no recorder — what a user pays
                 today when they *do* ask for a live view.

Selecting more than one prints a comparison block per case: ratio of medians
against the control, the control's own repeat spread, and per configuration the
log lines, bytes, flush count and run-directory size.  ``nfev`` and ``Rwp`` are
checked against the control on every row, because the claim being tested is
that telemetry changed no number — a configuration that moved either is not a
slower fit but a different one, and its ratio means nothing.

A series case takes the axis only through ``telemetry=``: its ``events=`` is
already spent on the collector that reads per-pattern wall clock off the
ladder, so ``events-path`` and ``live`` are refused there by name.

Columns
-------
``pairs`` is the (emission line, reflection) pair count summed over phases —
the quantity peak-loop cost scales with, and the reason the shipped baselines
under-weight the trigger case: they carry a few hundred where it carries
~1000+.  ``win`` is the mean window width in points.  ``free`` is the union of
what the plan's stages actually freed, read off the result rather than
re-derived from the globs.  ``nfev``/``njev`` are whole-fit totals across every
stage; the per-stage ``n_iterations`` breakdown (scipy's nfev per stage) prints
under each case.

``--profile`` re-runs each selected case **once** under cProfile and prints the
top 10 by tottime.  Profiled wall clock is inflated and is never quoted as a
timing; the ranking is what it is for.

# -- the trigger-shaped case, simulated ------------------------------------
#
# WP-1109's trigger was a 68-pattern in-situ series: 4 phases of ZrMo₂O₈,
# 4 165 points, ~41 free, Cu Kα, 105-600 s per pattern.  None of the three
# baselines above is within an order of magnitude of its peak count, and
# peak-loop cost scales with peaks × window width, so a ranking measured only
# on them under-weights exactly the term the trigger is dominated by.  No real
# ZrMo₂O₈ data ships with this repo, so the case below is **simulated** to that
# shape.
#
# WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT.  The four **cells** are the literature ones for
# a plausible ZrMo₂O₈ decomposition series — cubic ZrMo₂O₈ (Pa-3, Lind et al.
# 1998, Chem. Mater. 10, 2335), trigonal α-ZrMo₂O₈ (P-31c, Auray, Quarton &
# Tarte 1986, Acta Cryst. C42, 257), baddeleyite ZrO₂ (P2₁/c, Smith & Newkirk
# 1965, Acta Cryst. 18, 983) and MoO₃ (Pbnm, Kihlborg 1963, Ark. Kemi 21, 357)
# — quoted to the precision a *peak count* needs and no further.  Every **atom
# coordinate is invented**: species and rough site counts are chemically
# sensible, the positions are not refined values and are not read from any CIF.
# The phase names carry a ``sim-`` prefix for that reason, and nothing this
# case prints — Rwp, weight fractions, cell esds — is a structural or
# quantitative claim about any of these materials.  The WP licenses exactly
# this: for a *performance* benchmark the truth of the answer is irrelevant,
# and what must be realistic is peak count, overlap and window structure.
#
# HOW IT IS BUILT.  The truth model is evaluated on the 2θ grid, Poisson noise
# is added at a fixed seed (so the pattern is byte-identical between runs and
# machines), and the fit starts **cold**: cells 500 ppm high, widths at generic
# starting values, axial parameters low, background at zero, scales seeded by
# ``seed_scales``.  Rwp lands near 0.02 because the model that made the data is
# the model being fitted — the residual is pure counting noise.  That is a
# property of a simulation and it is why Rwp is only ever an identity check
# here; it does not make the *timing* less real, because the peak loop does the
# same work whatever the residual.

    succeeded is by construction the cheap one, the escalation having been
    reached because the first was rejected.  On the ``trigger-series`` case
    that hid 32.8 s of a 57.7 s series in two discarded first rungs: pattern 1
    read 3.21 s and had spent 20.3 s.  The pairs are therefore accumulated in
    arrival order and summed, and ``rungs`` prints the breakdown, because a
    number that omits the expensive half of the expensive patterns is the one
    number a speed milestone must not print.
