"""WP-1124: the warm-series continuation probe — does a predictor seed beat a copy?

Run: ``.venv/bin/python examples/bench_series_predictor.py``

`sequential.py` warm-starts pattern k+1 from pattern k's converged endpoint.
That is a **zeroth-order predictor** of a trajectory that moves smoothly along
the series coordinate.  The solver survey's §2.B8 claims a first-order one
lands closer, and closer matters twice: fewer iterations per warm fit (direct),
and fewer *rung escalations* (amplified — WP-1123 measured the same chain flip
from 1.04× worse to 1.12× better across one unrelated commit, because a bounded
per-fit difference becomes an escalation taken or avoided and the chain
integrates it).

This script measures that claim.  It ships **no** predictor: the two arms are
built out of ``SequentialRefinement.fit(prepare=…)``, a hook that already
exists, and the library is untouched — which is the same discipline WP-1114's
spike ran under, and the reason a negative verdict costs nothing to act on.

Three arms
----------
``copy``     the shipped default: ``prepare=None``, ``carry=("*",)``.  Every
             other arm is judged against this one and nothing else.
``secant``   seed pattern k+1 at ``θ_k + (θ_k − θ_{k−1})`` in **physical**
             values, per entry, shrunk to stay inside the entry's own bounds.
             Costs nothing but two dictionaries.
``tangent``  one Gauss-Newton step against pattern k+1's data from pattern k's
             converged state: solve ``J·δ ≈ −r`` at that state, both already
             weighted, and take θ + δ.  Costs one Jacobian and two residuals a
             pattern, and **the totals below charge it for them** — a predictor
             that buys ten iterations for the price of twelve is not a saving.

Four rules this script is written around
----------------------------------------
1. **The predictor is the first rung only.**  ``prepare`` is called on every
   ladder rung, the cold rescue included, and on the cold rung it would be
   handed the *initial* model rather than a warm one — extrapolating there
   corrupts the rescue.  So each arm acts on the first call per pattern and
   returns immediately on any later one, which leaves ``warm_staged`` and
   ``cold`` **bit-identical to the copy arm's**.  The predictor changes the
   first rung; the ladder stays the rescue it was.
2. **The secant needs two converged points, so it starts at pattern 2.**  At
   pattern 1 the only earlier state is the cold fit's answer and, before it,
   the initial guess — the difference between them is a cold-start correction,
   not a step along the series.  Pattern 1 therefore gets the copy seed in
   every arm.
3. **A quarantined pattern extrapolates to nothing, for free.**  The state
   ``prepare`` is handed is whatever ``_carry_into`` wrote, i.e. the last
   *accepted* endpoint; when the chain steps over a diverged pattern that
   state does not advance, the snapshot difference is identically zero and the
   predictor degenerates to the copy seed.  No special case is needed and none
   is written.
4. **Extrapolation is clamped as a step, never as a value.**  A softplus width
   sitting near zero extrapolates negative and a refused write would be a probe
   bug, not a finding (the WP says so).  ``_limited`` shrinks the step to keep
   ``keep`` of the gap to the bound, so a parameter already *at* its bound
   moves by exactly zero instead of by a repaired amount.

Read-outs
---------
Per arm: whole-chain wall, whole-chain ``nfev``/``njev`` (the WP-1111 counting
scaffold, imported rather than restated), predictor cost, per-pattern wall /
iterations / rung, escalation and quarantine counts, and **endpoint agreement**
against the copy arm in esd units — because a seed that changes the answer has
not made the same fit faster.  ``--direction both`` adds the path-dependence
read-out: a predictor changes the path, and ``SEQUENTIAL_PATH_DEPENDENT`` must
not worsen under it.

Wall clock is a range over ``--repeats``; run it idle and alone
(``bench_refinement``'s four rules apply here unchanged).
