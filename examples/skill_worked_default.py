"""The skill body's worked default (`docs/skill/rietx/SKILL.md` § 10), run.

§ 10 is the block an agent copies when it holds a Bragg-Brentano lab pattern
and a CIF and nothing else, so it has to run as written. Below it is verbatim,
except that the one line naming `sample.xy` and `phase.cif` is replaced by two
naming real files. The block shows no number specific to any one pattern:
generic names, the fitted range read from the data, the width seed measured
off its own peaks. So this script is a runnable check of generic code, not a
tuning to this file.

Data: GSAS-II tutorials `LabData`, `FAP.XRA` (Cu Kα, Bragg-Brentano), and
`fluorapatite.cif`, the starting model transcribed from the same tutorial.
Provenance and licence for both: `tests/data/README.md`.

**Two copies, held equal by a test.** The skill body cannot
`{literalinclude}` this file, because an agent reads `SKILL.md` raw, so
`tests/test_skill.py` asserts the two blocks agree line for line. The manual
needs no include of its own either: it renders the whole body, this code
included, through its skill chapter (`docs/manual/conf.py`, `_write_skill`).
It writes no output file, so it runs from any cwd.
