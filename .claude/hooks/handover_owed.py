"""Stop gate: a WP session's last act is ``/wp-handover``, not a summary of it.

The trigger used to survive on prose alone, and prose lost the moment it left
the context.  ``/wp-start`` step 2 read the whole of ``docs/ROADMAP.md``, whose
§ Session protocol step 3 says *End — or whenever interruption threatens — run
``/wp-handover``*; on 2026-09-01 that read was narrowed to the "Current focus"
section (commit ``3a273141``, 13k tokens to 1k) and the protocol stopped
arriving with it.  The **next two sessions both missed the handover** — WP-1324
stopped at "work is complete and committed", WP-1131 at "closed and handed
over … ready for /clear" having done the recording by hand — and the user had
to ask "did you run /wp-handover" in each.  Neither had run the checklist's
step 9 (``/code-review medium --fix``) or step 10 (verify against merged main).

So the trigger is measured here instead of remembered.  A **nudge, not a
gate**: the hook blocks one stop, says what is owed, and lets a session that
is not finished say so and carry on.

It fires only when every one of these holds, which is the end-state of a WP
session and almost nothing else:

* the tree is a worktree whose branch names a WP (``wp1131-…``);
* ``origin/main..HEAD`` carries at least one ``WP-NNNN:`` commit;
* the branch is **at rest** — working tree clean, nothing unpushed — which is
  where a session lands when it believes it is done, and is not where it sits
  between checklist items;
* this session's transcript shows no ``/wp-handover`` invocation;
* it has not already nudged for this HEAD (one stamp per commit, so a session
  that says "not finished" is not asked again until it lands more work).

``stop_hook_active`` is honoured on top of all that: the hook never blocks two
stops in a row, so a wrong call costs one turn and can never loop.  Stdlib-only
and **fails open**, like ``worktree_only.py``: any internal error lets the stop
through, because a session that cannot end costs more than a missed nudge.
