"""PreToolUse gate: a ``cd`` must live inside a subshell.

The Bash tool's working directory **persists between calls**, and the shell it
persists in is shared with the user's own ``!`` commands.  So a ``cd`` written
for one command silently retargets every later one, in this session and in the
user's hands, and nothing in ordinary output names the tree it landed in.  Two
measured cases, both in this repo:

* 2026-08-26, ``/pr-review``'s first outing — a ``cd`` added to a ``gh pr list``
  that did not need one sent the next four commands, ``reset --hard`` among
  them, into the user's main checkout instead of the bench worktree.
* 2026-08-26, same day, after the rule was written down — the session ended with
  the shell parked in the bench, and the *user's* next ``gh pr create`` failed
  with ``not on any branch``, because the bench runs detached.

The rule was prose in two places by then and lost anyway: over the seven
sessions preceding this hook, 125 of 660 Bash calls carried a top-level ``cd``
and **not one** used a form that does not persist.  Thirty-seven of those were
``cd`` back to the project root, which is a session undoing its own damage.
Hence a gate.

**What is allowed.** ``(cd X && ...)`` and ``$(cd X && ...)``, because a
subshell's chdir dies with the subshell; a ``cd`` inside a heredoc body, which
is script text being written, not a command being run; a ``cd`` inside quotes,
which is an argument (``bash -c "cd x && y"`` is another process); and the one
bare repair, ``cd <project root>`` alone, which cannot retarget anything because
there is nothing after it.  A brace group is **not** a subshell — ``{ cd x; }``
persists, and is refused.

**What it is not.** Not a claim that ``cd`` is wrong: it is a claim that the
target belongs in the command rather than in invisible session state.  Most
callers have a flag and should use it — ``git -C``, ``npm --prefix``,
``uv --directory``, ``pytest <path>`` — and the subshell is what covers the rest
(a venv build, ``.venv/bin/python`` against a relative path).

Stdlib-only, no network, and **fails open**: any internal error exits 0 and lets
the command through.  A parser bug here would otherwise brick every Bash call in
the project until someone edited settings.json, and this gate is worth less than
that costs.

Put the target in the command instead:
