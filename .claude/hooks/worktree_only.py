"""PreToolUse gate: work happens in a worktree, never in the main checkout.

Sessions launched in one checkout share its HEAD, index, stash and working
tree, so one session's ``checkout``, ``reset --hard`` or ``git add -A`` lands
in another's work — four times on 2026-08-26, with four live sessions in the
main checkout at once.  Prose about this lost every time; a gate does not.

So the main checkout is **read-only for a session**.  An ``Edit``/``Write``/
``NotebookEdit`` whose file lives in it, or a ``Bash`` command that would move
its HEAD or index, is refused with the one-line fix: ``EnterWorktree`` (or
``claude -w`` from the terminal).  Reads, ``gh``, fetches and tests are
untouched, a worktree under ``.claude/worktrees/`` is not the main checkout,
and a file outside any repository is nobody's.

**Only this checkout.**  The rationale above is about the repository the session
was launched in, so that is the only one guarded (WP-1410): auto memory, a
configuration repo, an unrelated clone are all somebody else's problem.  Before
scoping, any repository's main checkout matched, which refused every ``Write``
to ``~/.claude`` auto memory once that directory was symlinked into a repo.

Stdlib-only and **fails open**: any internal error lets the call through,
because a bricked session costs more than a missed refusal.  It says so on
stderr, because a gate disabled by a typo is indistinguishable from a working
one otherwise.
