"""WorktreeCreate hook: make the worktree Claude Code asked for, with its venv.

Claude Code hands the creation to this hook whenever one is configured — for
``claude -w``, ``EnterWorktree``, a subagent with ``isolation: worktree`` — and
uses whatever path it prints as the session's working directory.  Two things
are gained over the built-in creation, and they are why this file exists:

* **The venv is built here**, so a fresh tree is ready to test in the minute
  ``uv`` takes from a warm cache, and no session forgets it (a worktree
  running the main checkout's venv measures the main checkout's code —
  tests/CLAUDE.md § Quoting numbers).
* **Memory stays shared**: a worktree made by this hook keeps its transcript
  and auto-memory at the launch directory (docs, worktrees § Resume), where
  the built-in path gives each tree an empty memory of its own.

The branch is named after the worktree — ``wp1208-foo`` is the branch
``wp1208-foo``, the repo's convention — cut from ``origin/main`` after a fetch;
an existing branch of that name is checked out instead, which is how a session
resumes work on a branch after its tree was removed.  Failure to build the venv
is reported on stderr and does not block the tree: ``/wp-start`` step 4 sees
the hook's flag and builds it.  Any other failure exits nonzero, which is the
one blocking exit for this event.

**A WP another live session is working is refused here**, and this is the only
place in the session workflow that refuses rather than reports.  Two reasons it
earns the exception.  The trigger is narrow and observable — a ``claude``
process whose cwd is inside a tree that names the same WP — so it cannot fire
on a branch someone left behind, which is the false alarm that would teach the
reader to ignore it.  And this is the moment before the cost is paid: past it a
session spends hours duplicating work it will discover at handover, and git's
own refusal (a branch cannot be checked out in two worktrees) catches only the
case where both sessions chose the same *name*.

Git's refusal is also why the check is not merely advisory: the two mechanisms
answer the same question, and leaving the wider one advisory would mean the
narrower accident is blocked while the broader one is waved through.

A refusal names the release verb, because a refusal with no way past it is a
trap: a session parked idle in a tree it has finished with would block the next
one for ever.
