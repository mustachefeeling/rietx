"""Which WP each worktree is working, so two sessions never pick the same one.

Read-only by default, stdlib-only, and independent of the project venv, for the
same reason ``session_start.py`` is: the state it reports must survive a broken
or wrong-tree venv.

**A claim is held by a worktree, and a worktree is live when a session sits in
it.**  That is the whole model, and it is chosen because every part of it is
observable.  A worktree is in ``git worktree list``; a session is a ``claude``
process with a cwd (``session_start.live_sessions``); the WP is in the tree's
name by the repo's own convention (``/wp-start`` step 3 names a tree
``wp1422-<slug>`` and ``worktree_create.py`` cuts the branch to match).  So the
answer to "is anyone on WP-1422?" needs no ledger at all in the ordinary case,
and a ledger that can be forgotten is worse than one that is never needed.

What the ledger adds is the two cases the convention cannot carry, and nothing
else:

* **A tree whose name says the wrong WP.**  Measured on this repo 2026-09-15:
  a live session sat in ``.claude/worktrees/wp1404-what-recording-every-fit-costs``
  on branch ``wp1413-snapshot-cost``, working WP-1413.  The branch happened to
  say so; had the session reused the branch too, the derivation would have
  named 1404 and the real claim would have been invisible.
* **An override.**  ``worktree_create.py`` refuses a WP another live session
  holds, and a refusal with no way past it is a trap: a session parked idle in
  a tree it has finished with would block the next one for ever.  ``release``
  is that way past, and it is one line printed in the refusal itself.

So the declaration only ever *sharpens* the derivation.  Skipping it degrades
to the branch name rather than to nothing, which is why no step of ``/wp-start``
is load-bearing for this to work.

**A claim carries who made it, and only a session's outranks the branch.**  The
claim ``worktree_create.py`` writes is the tree's own name read back, so ranking
it with a session's would re-elevate the weakest source above the strongest and
pin the measured tree above to 1404 for ever — the exact case this exists to get
right.  The hook's claim still beats the tree *name*, which is what it is for: a
detached HEAD, or a branch later renamed to something naming no WP.  ``by`` is
therefore not bookkeeping, and a writer that omits it changes the ranking.

**Where the files live.**  ``<git-common-dir>/wp-claims/``.  Git guarantees the
common dir is shared by every worktree of a repository (measured: the main
checkout, a worktree, and a worktree nested inside a worktree all resolve
``git rev-parse --git-common-dir`` to the same path), it is untracked, no
``git status`` sees it, and a fresh clone starts empty.  A tracked file could
not work: a claim has to be visible across branches that never merge.

**Staleness cannot accumulate.**  A claim whose worktree is gone is deleted on
the next read, so the ledger can never outlive the trees it describes and there
is no expiry policy to tune.  ``worktree_remove.py`` needs no cooperation, and
a claim survives exactly as long as the work does.  This matters more than it
looks: ``session_start.py``'s docstring records that a false alarm costs more
than no alarm, because it teaches the reader to skip the one line that is ever
load-bearing.

**Two states, not three.**  A claim with a live session in its tree is *held*;
one without is *dormant*.  Dormant is not a problem and is not reported at
session start — it is the ordinary state of a tree whose session has ended with
the work unfinished, and it is what ``/wp-start`` reads to find that work again.
Only *held* bears on a clash.

# this repo were `pr/skill-recipe-rows-7g`, `pr/cell-degenerate-guard` and
# `cw-neutron-seed` — every one on a **fork**, so absent from

# Both halves of the local model are therefore blind to them by construction.
#
# What contributors do key on is **issues**: those PRs cite #287 and #283, and
# every WP file cites the issues it closes (the triage's own audit greps
# ``#N\b`` across ``docs/wp/``).  So the chain that reaches a contributor is
# PR → issue → WP, and it needs no new convention from anyone.  Issue
# *assignment* was measured and rejected: 0 of 78 open issues carried an
# assignee, so building on it would mean asking contributors to adopt a habit
# they do not have.
#
# **Reported, never refused, and never in the SessionStart hook.**  This tier
# needs the network and a ``gh`` login, while that hook must stay stdlib-only,
# offline-safe and fast (0.246 s).  "Is this WP taken?" is asked once, when
# picking, so it lives in ``/wp-start`` step 2.  And a WP citing an issue a PR
# addresses is *evidence of overlap*, not proof of a clash — #287 is cited by
