description: Review outside pull requests — triage the backlog, or work it top-down: merge the clear-cut, batch every human call to the end
---

Review pull requests from outside the repository. `$ARGUMENTS`: PR numbers
(reviewed in the order given), `all` (work the whole backlog, § Working the
backlog), or empty (triage, print the ranked backlog, stop — never start on the
top row unasked).

Other people's PRs only. The maintainer's own are gated by `/wp-handover`
steps 6 and 9; a number naming one is still re-gated, but the governance
signal (rank 2) and the public review (step 8) do not apply, and you say so in
one line. Most outside PRs are one recurring contributor's: write the public
review to a colleague who knows the codebase. That is a register and moves no
gate — least of all step 4's execution check, since familiarity is not
provenance.

## Where this command runs

Triage reads the remote and runs from anywhere. Before step 4, and before the
`all` mode's pass B, enter the bench: `EnterWorktree` with
`path: .claude/worktrees/pr-bench` — a persistent worktree with a `[dev,jax]`
venv, created once by `git worktree add --detach .claude/worktrees/pr-bench
origin/main` plus step 4's venv line and, run in the bench,
`git config --worktree merge.wpindex.driver 'git merge-file %A %O %B'`. From then on every command runs from the
bench as plain `git`, and the main checkout is never named (`worktree_only.py`
keeps it read-only anyway). The worktree guard refuses `git -C .`, a shell
variable in a git command, and a git command inside a loop or a compound
pipeline. A multi-step check goes in a scratchpad script, run as one plain
command.

**The bench merges as GitHub does.** GitHub's merge runs no custom driver, so
it merges `docs/wp/README.md` as text. Every local tree runs the `wpindex` row
merge on that file instead (`.gitattributes`). So every `merge` and
`merge-tree` in the bench swaps the row merge for git's text merge on its own
command line:

```sh
git -c merge.wpindex.driver='git merge-file %A %O %B' merge --no-edit refs/pr/N
```

This document calls that flag **the text-merge flag**, and every merge command
below carries it. Since 2026-10-07 the bench also sets the same line in its
own config, so a command that drops the flag still merges as text.
`extensions.worktreeConfig` is on for the repository, and in the bench
`git config --get merge.wpindex.driver` must print the line above. Every other
tree reads the row merge from `.git/config`.

The line takes no `--diff-algorithm`. Apple's git 2.39.5 has no such option on
`merge-file`, and nor has 2.43. A driver git cannot start exits nonzero, and
git reports every merge that reaches it as a conflict. The flag carried
`--diff-algorithm=histogram` from 2026-10-01 to 2026-10-07. Rebuilt with it on
2026-10-07, main's last 60 merges gave 6 conflicts. Those were exactly the 6
merges that changed the index on both sides, and GitHub had merged all of them
clean. Without the option all 60 rebuilt to GitHub's tree. A false conflict
there sends step 4 to sync a branch that needed no sync.

The cost is the diff algorithm. Plain `merge-file` runs myers, while git's own
merge runs histogram, and the two disagreed on 6 of 1500 random merges. Under
the row merge the bench called clean the index conflicts GitHub reported on
#522, #546, #579 and #580. The histogram line reported all four, but it
reports a conflict on every two-sided index merge, so that check shows
nothing. They have not been re-checked under this line.

## Triage — the no-argument mode

One network call, no checkout, no diff:

```sh
gh pr list --state open --limit 30 \
  --json number,title,author,files,changedFiles,mergeStateStatus,latestReviews,headRefOid,updatedAt,statusCheckRollup,commits
```

- **Reviewable size is a jq filter over `files[]`**, excluding
  `^tests/data/|^src/rietx/data/` — never a diff (#125: 48,791 lines, 708
  reviewable).
- **`mergeStateStatus`, not `mergeable`**: `BLOCKED` PRs report `MERGEABLE`;
  `DIRTY` is the conflict, `CLEAN` the only state step 9 merges from.
- **`changedFiles` beside `files[]`**: the array caps at 100 and under-reports
  size and collision degree downward; when they differ, say so.
- **`latestReviews[].commit`** is the sha a *review* (not a comment) was posted
  at — what makes the `all` mode's skip check a field.
- **`commits[].messageHeadline` is the only place a contributor's WP work is
  visible**: a PR prefixing its commits `WP-NNNN:` edits no `docs/wp/` file, so
  `files[]` cannot see it (#98: 45 `WP-1118:` commits, every one of them in
  `src/` and `tests/`). The field carries each commit's *body* too: it took the
  call from 27 kB to 60 kB on a three-PR backlog, so read it through jq, never
  raw.

Print one row per PR — number, title, reviewable lines, merge state, CI,
whether a maintainer has commented — **and the reason for its rank**:

1. **Touches an in-flight WP** — `Status:` 🔄 in a `docs/wp/[0-9]*.md` the PR
   edits, **or** a `WP-NNNN:` commit prefix naming one. Either way a live
   session owns that WP's file.
2. **Outside PR edits `docs/ROADMAP.md` or `docs/wp/**`** — a governance
   question for the user (`CONTRIBUTING.md` § Maintainer-only machinery), cheap
   and blocking nothing. Author-conditional: on the maintainer's own PR it is
   the work. **The two edits CONTRIBUTING hands a contributor are not the
   question**: a claim (the WP's `Status:` line set to `🔄 <date> — claimed by
   @…`, with `docs/wp/README.md` regenerated) and a handover-log entry for the
   work the PR does. Read the hunk; only what goes beyond those two ranks here.
   A claim that merges leaves `Status:` reading "claimed" on main, so the step 9
   handover entry is what rewrites it.
3. **`DIRTY`** — not a review: post a one-line rebase request and move on.
   A conflict on the index alone is the exception: step 4 syncs it, and the
   PR keeps its place. GitHub computes the field lazily; once main has moved
   since the call, `git -c merge.wpindex.driver='git merge-file %A %O %B' merge-tree --write-tree
   --name-only --no-messages origin/main refs/pr/N`, run in the bench, is the authority. Nonzero
   is a conflict, and the lines after the tree name the conflicted paths. It
   runs in the bench because any other tree's row merge hides an index
   conflict (§ Where this command runs).
4. **Collision degree** (files shared with other open PRs), ascending — every
   merge stales the diffs sharing a file with it.
5. **Reviewable lines**, ascending.

List the maintainer's own open PRs, marked, last. Two limits, stated once: the
rank does not know which small PR unblocks unstarted work, and degree counts
files, not difficulty. The user overrules with arguments.

## Working the backlog — the `all` mode

Triage, then work the queue. Every disposition step 9 already calls clear-cut
is made as it is reached; everything else is **deferred to one batch at the
end**, never asked mid-run. `all` authorises step 9's merges and step 4's
index syncs, and nothing beyond them.

**Pass A — no checkout**, straight off the triage call:

- `DIRTY` → rebase request; out of the queue. On the index alone (rank 3's
  `merge-tree`) → stays in the queue, and step 4 syncs it.
- Maintainer's own → one line (gated by `/wp-handover`); out.
- Touches an in-flight WP → **batch, do not review** (a live session's files
  are that person's call). The batch item carries the evidence: what the 🔄
  records (a session's claim, or only work that "landed from outside") and the
  WP file's last touch (`git log -1 -- docs/wp/NNNN-*.md`). A 🔄 kept open by
  the same contributor's earlier PRs is usually free, and the user answers in
  a word.
- Outside edit to `docs/ROADMAP.md` / `docs/wp/**` beyond a claim or its own
  handover entry (rank 2) → question to the batch; the PR **stays** (its code
  half is reviewable).
- Touches an execution-shaped path (step 4's list) → batch.
- Already reviewed and nothing since → skip, naming the sha. Test:
  `latestReviews[].commit == headRefOid` **and** `updatedAt` no later than that
  review's `submittedAt` (keyed on the sha alone it skips forever a contributor
  who answered without pushing).

**Pass B — review what is left, in throughput order**: collision degree, then
reviewable lines (print the attention rank once; work this order). Steps 1-10
apply with four changes: conformance always goes to `pr-conformance` agents
(the run's length is the constraint, not one PR's size); a review held on a
question (step 8) joins the batch; step 9's "stop and ask" becomes "defer and
continue"; the per-PR report shrinks to its decision line.

**After every merge**: `git fetch origin main` and re-test every remaining PR
with `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main refs/pr/N`, carrying the
text-merge flag — the field is stale
from the first merge on. The order is not recomputed, only the conflicts. A
conflict is handled as rank 3 handles `DIRTY`.

**Context checkpoint — between PRs only.** Compaction mid-diff loses the
reading, so stop at a PR boundary once the context nears **500 K tokens**. Read
the context off the transcript itself, whose assistant entries carry the
API's `usage`. The last one's `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens +
cache_read_input_tokens` is the context that call saw:

```sh
python3 -c 'import json,sys
u=None
for l in open(sys.argv[1]):
    try: m=json.loads(l).get("message")
    except ValueError: continue
    if isinstance(m,dict) and isinstance(m.get("usage"),dict): u=m["usage"]
print(sum(u.get(k,0) for k in ("input_tokens","cache_creation_input_tokens","cache_read_input_tokens")))' \
  ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl
```

The id is the scratchpad's directory, and the slug is the directory the
session *started* in (the bench's own slug when it started there). Measure
before the first PR and at every boundary. Stop when the next PR's projected
delta would carry the total past 500 K. Without the usage field, `wc -c` is
the fallback: **500 K tokens was 4.3 MB** of transcript on 2026-09-29, when
the old 2 MB mark was only about 300 K. The ratio drifts from 5 to 9 bytes a
token as tool output accumulates, so give the fallback a PR's margin.
Ending means: ask the batch, apply the answers, write the report, kill this
run's waiters (step 5), and name the resume command (`/pr-review all` after
the user's `/compact` or `/clear`). Nothing is carried in a file.

**The batch**: one numbered message; per item the PR, the question in one
sentence, what it blocks (held review / merge / nothing), and your
recommendation. Group: governance calls, then held reviews, then held merges.
`AskUserQuestion` only for ≤ 4 genuine multi-way choices. Then apply in one
pass — post, merge, close — with a step-10 line each. **A gate main has moved
under is void**: before merging a freed PR compare `origin/main` with the sha
its ladder ran on; moved → rebuild the merged tree and re-run step 5 and the
slow suite, or defer to the next run, and say which. A stack's own merges
are the one exception: they move main toward the gated tree, not away from
it (step 9).

**Report** once for the run (step 10's shape), then the batch, then the resume
line if the checkpoint ended it. Close with
`Backlog: N merged, N posted, N rebase requested, N held, N remaining`.

## Reviewing one PR

1. **Read the thread once** — `gh pr view N --comments`; it is the record.
   Earlier rounds → review only `<last-reviewed-sha>..<head>`
   (`latestReviews[].commit`) and say which round. Once the branch has taken
   main in, by a rebase or a step-4 sync, that range carries main's changes
   too. Diff the two merged trees instead: `git diff A B`, where A and B are
   the trees `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main` prints for the
   last-reviewed sha and for the head, each with the text-merge flag. A
   rebased branch whose last-reviewed sha no longer merges onto main needs
   the PR's own patch compared at the two shas instead, each against its
   merge base.
   On #546's rebased round 4 the range showed 14 files and the trees one,
   the regenerated index.
2. **Classify files before reading**: code / docs / gui / data, then
   `git diff BASE HEAD -- . ':(exclude)tests/data/*' ':(exclude)src/rietx/data/*'`.
   Never a bare `gh pr diff`.
3. **Data files by property, never content**: line and column count, header,
   file mode, a provenance row in `tests/data/README.md`, a
   `tests/validation_matrix.py` row where a standard is claimed, and a licence
   stated where it ships for anything under `src/rietx/data/` (root `CLAUDE.md`
   § Licensing). Nothing enforces any of this.
4. **Bench and merged tree.** One worktree, one venv; never one per PR.
   - **Read before you execute**: the bench runs the branch's code
     (`uv pip install -e .` runs its build config, pytest imports its
     `conftest.py`). Read every hunk to `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, any
     `conftest.py`, `.github/**`, `.claude/hooks/**` and `.claude/settings*.json`
     first; a workflow change is a question for the user, not a finding.
     **The rest of `.claude/` is text, not execution** — skills, commands and
     agent definitions are markdown the bench never runs, and treating the whole
     directory as execution-shaped batched three PRs that only sync markdown.
     They are read as part of the diff like anything else; what they can carry is
     an instruction aimed at whoever reads them, which is a conformance question
     rather than a reason to hold the PR out of review.
   - **Run from the bench, `cd` nowhere** — plain `git`, `npm --prefix gui`;
     `no_top_level_cd.py` refuses a bare `cd`.
   - **One `/pr-review` at a time**: the session-start hook names a live
     session already in the bench; a second one stops.
   - **The suite is shared with every WP session**: `pgrep -f "[p]ytest"`
     before step 5 and again before step 9 (`tests/CLAUDE.md` § Running).
     Another mid-suite is a stop: wait.

   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   git fetch origin "pull/N/head:refs/pr/N" --force
   git reset --hard origin/main
   git -c merge.wpindex.driver='git merge-file %A %O %B' merge --no-edit refs/pr/N
   git diff origin/main --stat        # the PR's own contribution
   ```

   Fetch into `refs/pr/N`, never `FETCH_HEAD` (it is per worktree; the named
   ref is what the round-2 diff and `merge-tree` want). `reset --hard` is the
   whole reset — never `git clean -fdx`, which takes `gui/node_modules`,
   `docs/manual/_generated`, `tests/output/`, any `*.rex/` and the venv. **The
   merged tree is the tree under test**: branch protection is `strict: false`,
   so nothing else ever tests it; a conflict here *is* the finding — report,
   ask for a rebase, stop. A conflict on the index alone is the exception,
   synced below. Venv:
   `uv venv --python 3.12 && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e ".[dev,jax]"`,
   reinstalled only when the PR touches `pyproject.toml`; `[dev,jax]` matches
   `nightly.yml`'s full job so counts compare and cross-backend rows pass
   rather than skip.

   **Sync an index-only conflict yourself.** GitHub refuses that merge too,
   but regenerating the index fixes it, and a rebase request costs the
   contributor a round trip. Sync when `git diff --name-only
   --diff-filter=U` lists only `docs/wp/README.md` and `gh pr view N --json
   maintainerCanModify` is true (9 of 9 open fork PRs on 2026-10-01).
   Otherwise ask for a rebase.

   ```sh
   git merge --abort
   git checkout --detach refs/pr/N
   git -c merge.wpindex.driver='git merge-file %A %O %B' merge --no-edit origin/main     # conflicts on the index alone
   python3 .claude/hooks/wp_index.py
   git add docs/wp/README.md
   git commit -m "Merge main and regenerate docs/wp/README.md" \
     -m "Synced with Claude Code on behalf of @yue-here."
   gh pr view N --json headRepositoryOwner,headRepository,headRefName
   git push https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git HEAD:refs/heads/BRANCH
   git fetch origin "pull/N/head:refs/pr/N" --force
   ```

   Then rerun the block above from `reset --hard`. The push is a
   fast-forward, so it never needs `--force`. A rejected push means the
   contributor pushed in the meantime: fetch and start again. The push
   reruns CI, and step 9 waits for it to go green. Name the sync commit in the
   review. Measured on #585 (2026-10-01): the synced head had no conflict
   markers, passed `wp_index.py --check` and merged clean onto main. Against
   main it changed only the PR's own 18 files.
5. **Run the ladder the touched paths select**, every pytest with
   `-n auto --dist loadgroup`, from the bench:
   - **docs/manual only** → `test_docs_consistency.py`, `test_manual.py`,
     `test_manual_api.py`, the `-W` sphinx build.
   - **`gui/` only** → `npm --prefix gui ci && npm --prefix gui run build`,
     `git diff --exit-code src/rietx/gui/static`, `npm --prefix gui test`,
     `npm --prefix gui run check` (`gui.yml` is not a required check).
   - **`src/` or `tests/`** → the fast suite, then the slow tests covering the
     PR's area.
   - **always** → `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests examples`.

   The slow selection is the point: `ci.yml` runs `-m "not slow"` and
   `nightly.yml` has no `pull_request` trigger, so acceptance never runs on a
   PR and CI green tells you little (#108's red got through that way). The
   **whole** `-m slow` suite fires once, at step 9. Quote counts with venv and
   platform, wall clock as a range, and whether anything else was running.
   **A backgrounded run is yours until you kill it**: before the run ends,
   `pgrep -f "$SCRATCH"` and kill every waiter this session started (seven
   orphans from a dead run were once found still polling the bench).
6. **Conformance against `CLAUDE.md`, sized to what the main session carries.**
   Everything the main session reads, every later request it makes re-reads at
   the cache-read price. A subagent's reading ends with the agent. Cache reads
   are nearly all of a review's bill, so delegate unless the diff is small *and*
   the session is young.
   - **Breakeven** (measured 2026-09-30 on three runs' transcripts, at Opus 5.5
     prices): a `pr-conformance` agent (Sonnet, ~38K base context) pays above
     ~100 reviewable lines. A general-purpose reader (~70K base) pays above
     ~200, falling toward ~100 once the main context passes 300K. Below those
     it is a wash, so read the diff yourself.
   - **Size of the saving:** a read-only Opus reader cost $2-3 a PR, roughly half
     what the same reading costs mid-run in the main session. Six PRs read
     in-session would have taken a 306K context past the context checkpoint.
   - **Sonnet saves less than its list price suggests:** its cache reads cost
     the same as Opus 5.5's, so it saves only on writes and output.

   To delegate, write the reviewable diff to `$SCRATCH` once and dispatch one
   `pr-conformance` agent per touched subtree, pointed at that file and the
   subtree's `CLAUDE.md`. Give each agent
   the PR's tree as files, `git archive refs/pr/N | tar -x -C
   "$SCRATCH/tree-N"`, never the bench: the bench holds whichever tree step 5
   is testing, and a PR based on current main is its own merged tree.
   **Verify every finding yourself before posting.** The breakeven already
   counts that check: about one main-session request per twelve the agent
   made. Do not restate invariants
   here; the
   classes outsiders miss most: a `Literal` member or defaulted field with no
   writer, physics without a citation, a correction offering an Rwp comparison
   as evidence, a reader repairing a file without a diagnostic, GPL-derived
   code, a diagnostic code or a measured operating rule with no agent-skill
   row (root CLAUDE.md § skill: the body, or the task shape's reference),
   physics with Part 1 prose but no Part 2 equation.
7. **`/code-review medium N`** for `src/` changes above step 6's ~200 lines;
   name the level (unnamed, it reuses whatever was typed last). **Never while a
   suite holds the bench**: the review forks into the session's working
   directory and checks the PR head out there. On 2026-09-29 that swapped the
   tree under a running full suite and voided it (`pgrep -f "[p]ytest"` first,
   and `git log -1` after, back to the tree step 5 wants). Run it
   before step 5 starts, or between suites. Verify its findings as you do the
   agents', by reading the code and, where it is cheap, by running it.
8. **Two audiences.** *Public*, posted **as a review, from a file** (so the sha
   lands in `latestReviews[].commit`): what you checked independently and what
   it produced; a numbered "before merge" list; follow-ups kept separate; then
   `*Reviewed with Claude Code on behalf of @yue-here.*`
   ```sh
   gh pr review N --comment --body-file "$SCRATCH/review-N.md"
   gh pr merge N --merge --body "Reviewed with Claude Code on behalf of @yue-here."
   ```
   *Private*, in the terminal: what the PR is for and changes for a user, in
   plain language with no symbols in the opening paragraph; what ran; open
   questions. **Findings go public, questions come to the user** (design
   wanted at all? maintainer machinery edited?), and no review is posted while
   one is outstanding — in the `all` mode it is held for the batch.
9. **Merge only the clear-cut**, `gh pr merge --merge --body …`, when **all**
   hold: required checks green and `mergeStateStatus` `CLEAN`; the step-5
   ladder green on the merged tree, counts quoted; the **full `-m slow` suite
   green on the merged tree**, nothing else mid-suite, against the main that is
   there *now*; no execution-shaped file without the step-4 read; no
   conformance finding; no new public surface undocumented; every data file
   with provenance (and a licence if in the wheel); no maintainer-machinery
   edit; no open question. Name which each merge satisfied. **Say which PRs
   you merged**: `origin/main` moves under every live WP session. Close only
   when the contributor asked or the work was folded into another PR.
   Anything else stops and asks (`all`: defers).

   **Stack the clear-cut PRs that replay clean, and gate the stack once.** A
   full `-m slow` run costs 50-75 min on a 4-core box, so when several PRs
   have passed steps 1-8, replay their merges onto the bench in the order
   GitHub will merge them. Start from `origin/main` and run
   `git merge --no-edit refs/pr/N` with the text-merge flag, once per PR. GitHub tests each
   PR against the main the previous merge left, and the replay asks the same
   question with the bench's text merge. This is a merge queue built by hand,
   and like one it decides membership by the merged result, not by which
   files the PRs share.
   - **A conflict on the index alone stays in the stack.** Regenerate the
     index, `git add` it and commit, as step 4's sync does. On GitHub, sync
     that PR once the PR before it has merged. Replayed on #578, #579 and
     #580, this path built the same tree as syncing each head and merging
     them in turn (2026-10-01).
   - **Any other conflict drops the PR** (`git merge --abort`)
     with a rebase request.
   - **Before the gate, read every hand-written file that two stacked PRs
     both change**, as the stack combined it:
     `git diff origin/main HEAD -- <file>`. Each review saw only
     its own half of that file. A problem there drops the later PR and goes
     in its review. Intersect each PR's
     `git diff --name-only origin/main...refs/pr/N` to find the files. The
     index needs no read, because `test_the_wp_index_is_the_generators_output`
     checks it.

   Run step 5's suites and the slow gate once on that tree, and note its sha
   before any sync moves the bench. Then merge on GitHub in the replay's
   order. The last merge leaves `origin/main` content-identical to the tree
   the gate ran on: check it with `git diff <stack-sha> origin/main`, which
   must be empty, and say so in each review's "what ran". A PR whose review
   is still open stays out. A red stack is bisected before anything in it
   merges, by replaying it again without the suspect. On 2026-09-29 three PRs
   went in on one 76-minute full run instead of three.

   **And say which issues the merge closed.** Read
   `gh pr view N --json closingIssuesReferences` before merging. A PR that
   fixes an issue without linking it (a keyword in backticks, `/wp-handover`
   step 11) leaves the issue open with its fix on main; close it after the
   merge with a one-line comment naming the PR, in step 8's public register.
   One left open is what `/issue-review`'s landed column exists to find, so
   the miss costs a later round rather than the fix.

   **A merge that lands part of an in-flight WP owes that WP a handover entry,
   and nothing will ask for it.** Two ways in, and only the first is mechanical:
   the PR carries `WP-NNNN:` commits, **or** its content is a task an open WP
   declares and has not checked off. An outside contributor has no reason to
   prefix a commit or to edit a WP file, so the second way is invisible to every
   check there is — #248 is the GSAS `.PRM` half of WP-1118's unticked
   `.EXP`/`.PRM` task and names neither. Read the open WPs' task lists at step 1,
   not at merge. `session_start.py`'s order rule is satisfied by
   *any* later touch of the WP file and its date rule is day-dated, so a
   same-day session editing that file for its own reasons clears both: PR #98's
   45 `WP-1118:` commits merged (`0576726f`, 2026-09-01) with the WP file
   untouched and the scan stayed quiet, and the entry was rebuilt a session
   later out of `git log --stat`, which cannot recover a reason the diff does
   not state. Pay it here, where the reading still exists.
   `git fetch origin main`, branch off it, add a
   `### YYYY-MM-DD` entry to `docs/wp/NNNN-*.md` (the template's
   multi-session suffix when the day already carries one) naming the PR, its
   merge sha and what your review established — what the merge makes possible,
   what it deliberately does not, the gotchas you found — update the `Status:`
   line, and open it as a PR. Docs only, so no ladder; not yours to merge,
   being the maintainer's own. Then put the bench back where step 4 expects it
   (`git checkout --detach origin/main`), or the next PR's
   `reset --hard` rewrites the branch you just pushed. A WP a *live session* owns
   never reaches this step — rank 1 batches it on the two signals that mean
   someone is mid-edit — so the entry can never collide with a live session's
   log. A WP that is merely open reaches it often, and that is the case above:
   `Status:` 🔄 means the WP has unfinished tasks, not that anyone is holding it.
   Check before assuming either — for #248 the last touch of the WP file was six
   days back and its only worktree branch was already merged and gone.

    open questions, the URL, and exactly `PR N: <decision>` — `merged`
    (`merged, handover PR M` where step 9's entry was owed),
    `closed`, `review posted`, `rebase requested`, `held, waiting on you`,
    plus `skipped (reviewed at <sha>)` and `deferred (<criterion>)` in the
    `all` mode. Kill this run's waiters first (step 5).
