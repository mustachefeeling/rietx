"""The open issues, cross-referenced against the tree: ``/issue-review``'s first act.

Three network calls and one ``git log``, then everything else is local. One
file per open issue lands in the output directory (title, dates, author,
labels, the cross-references, the body, every comment), and one table goes to
stdout. The skill reads the files and works from the table.

Why a script rather than the ``gh`` calls written into the skill: the triage
of 2026-09-15 lost 16 of 21 issue bodies to ``gh issue view --comments``,
which prints the comments and drops the body, and then spent four retries on
the worktree guard, which refuses a ``for`` loop over numbers and a shell
variable in a path. One plain ``python3`` command is the shape the guard
accepts, and the cross-references are what the skill's placing step needs on
every issue anyway.

The cross-references, each a column of the table:

* **WPs citing it**, with each WP's status glyph. The citation is the triage
  record. Every WP file names the issues it answers as ``#N``, the triage's
  own audit greps for exactly that, and ``wp_claim.py`` reads the same text
  to connect a contributor's PR to a WP. So an issue no WP or ROADMAP line
  cites has not been triaged, and the table says ``untriaged``.
* **Open PRs citing it**, forks included, through ``wp_claim.open_prs``: the
  fix may be in flight on someone else's machine.
* **Merged PRs and commits on ``origin/main`` citing it.** A fix lands
  without its issue closing more often than not: a closing keyword written in
  backticks closes nothing (``/wp-handover`` step 11), and WP-1310 filed
  three defects of which two had been fixed before it was written. Issue
  state is no evidence either way, so the table carries the evidence. A
  reference that touched only the planning record (``PLACEMENT``: WP files,
  the ROADMAP, milestone and release records, ``.claude/``, a ``CLAUDE.md``,
  and the test file that holds the ROADMAP's size cap) is a *placement*,
  since a triage PR cites every issue it files, and goes to the per-issue
  file rather than this column. With placements counted, 65 of 86 open
  issues carried a "landed" reference on 2026-09-21 and the column said
  nothing. A manual or skill change is not a placement: for a docs issue it
  is the fix. Merge commits are skipped, since the PR they merge is a
  reference of its own and ``--name-only`` lists no files for them.

Issue and pull-request numbers share one sequence on GitHub, so ``#408`` in a
merge commit's subject can never be an open issue's number, and the ``#N``
regex needs no disambiguation.

Stdlib only, run with ``python3`` from PATH, like the hooks it sits beside: it
runs before the round's venv exists. Every ``gh`` failure is a sentence, never
an empty table, since "no PRs" and "could not look" must not read alike.

Usage::

    python3 .claude/skills/issue-review/backlog.py OUT_DIR [N ...]

``OUT_DIR`` is spelled out (the guard refuses a variable in a path); with
issue numbers given, only those are written and tabulated, though every open
issue is still fetched, since ``gh issue list`` cannot filter by number.
