"""How badly-scaled and gradient-free columns reach a reported esd (WP-1110 §14).

The defect these guard against does not show up as a failure, a warning or a
missing number.  It shows up as an esd that is *small*: ``np.linalg.pinv``
discards every eigenvalue below ``rcond × |λ|max``, so one column with a large
gradient sets the cutoff for all of them, and a direction the data does not
constrain is returned with **zero** variance rather than infinite.  On the fit
this WP measured, ``phases.0.gauss_size`` came back 6.1e-14 ± 9.9e-11 — a
figure a reader would quote — where the equilibrated inverse says ± 4.3e+08.

The load-bearing test here is
``test_an_esd_does_not_depend_on_another_parameters_units``.  It needs no
dataset and no tolerance argument: if rescaling one column moves a *different*
column's esd, the inversion is wrong, and it moved by a factor of two.
