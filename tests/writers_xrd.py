"""Writers for the **binary** vendor formats, which have no vendorable fixture.

The text formats' writers live inline in ``test_readers.py``: writing a
``.uxd`` or a ``.ras`` is writing lines, and a line is self-describing.  A
binary format is not, and packing one raises a circularity the text ones never
face — a fixture built from the reader's own understanding agrees with the
reader by construction and proves nothing about the format.  Three rules keep
that from being what these writers are:

1. **The offsets here are written literally, and are not shared with the
   reader.**  Not an import, not a constant, not a helper: if
   ``bruker_raw.py``'s field table drifts, these functions keep packing the old
   one and the tests fail.  A writer that consulted the reader could only ever
   confirm that the reader agrees with itself.
2. **The offsets were cross-checked against a second, independent
   description.**  For Bruker RAW v4 the two that agree are (a) the real file
   ``tests/data/bruker_raw4_scrambled.raw``, walked byte by byte and reported in
   ``tests/data/README.md``, and (b) GSAS-II's ``G2pwd_BrukerRAW.py``, read as a
   specification only.  Where a third description exists — FAIRmat's
   ``bruker_raw_parser.py`` — it is not independent: it hard-codes absolute
   offsets taken from that same file.  For **v3** there are three that agree —
   GSAS-II, ``bracerino/xrd-file-converter`` (MIT) and ``reductus/reductus``
   (Unlicense), the last a field-by-field transcription of Bruker's own header
   definition — and **no** file at all, which is why v3's gates in the reader
   are the strict ones.
3. **The reader carries a self-consistency gate**, so a wrong parse raises
   rather than returning plausible garbage: a range header's nested segment
   chain must end *exactly* on the declared ``hdrSize``, and
   ``data + datumSize·nSteps`` must land on the next range or on EOF.  These
   writers exist partly to violate those gates on purpose.

So what a synthesized file exercises is the reader's **failure paths and its
options** — a second range, a narrower datum, a drive that is not 2θ, a header
that overruns — never the format itself.  The real fixture is the only evidence
about the format, and it is evidence about structure alone (its intensities are
scrambled; ``tests/data/README.md`` has the measurement).

    agreeing with it by construction.

    **A count the format cannot hold is refused, not quietly moved.**  The
    encoding is lossy above ~100 counts: ``v = isqrt(100·c)`` inverts
