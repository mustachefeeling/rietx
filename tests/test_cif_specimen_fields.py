"""``Structure.to_cif`` states the crystal, not the specimen: what that drops, pinned.

The manual (``using/data.md``) and ``Structure.to_cif``'s docstring say a CIF
carries the cell, positions, occupancies and displacement parameters, and that
the phase scale and the sample-broadening, extinction and preferred-orientation
fields come back at their defaults.  A magnetic width was dropped the same way
and no document said so (``magnetic_lor_strain`` 0.4 → 0 in an exporter
benchmark), so this holds the sentence true: when a writer starts carrying one of
these, this test goes red and the manual changes with it.
