"""The magnetic form-factor table as a whole: self-consistency, a fingerprint, the rows a fix touched.

``tests/test_magnetic.py`` pins the dipole expression and a handful of rows. Until 2026-10-01 nothing compared the
*whole* table with anything, and the Ni³⁺ pair had been CrysFML's rather than Brown's since the table was written
(issue #593). Since #626 the table is two stores: Brown's 7-parameter rows (``_J0``/``_J2``) and Lisher & Forsyth's
(1971) 5-parameter Pr³⁺ (``_J0_LISHER``/``_J2_LISHER``); every check below runs on both. The tests here need no
second copy of the table:

* **physics the coefficients must obey** (checks A-D of the verification), derived from the small-s expansions of
  Brown's eq. 4.4.5.1, j₀(x) = 1 − x²/6 + … and j₂(x) = x²/15 + …, with x = 4πs·r. They fail on a wrong prefactor,
  a ⟨j₂⟩ row taken from another ion, a transposed exponent, an ion-shifted pair and a wrong charge label;
* **a fingerprint** of every coefficient, which fails on any edit to any digit, including the one-digit exponent
  change that none of the physics checks can see;
* **the two rows the fix replaced**, as printed, so the fingerprint is not the only thing that knows them;
* **the retired "Ce2+" key**, refused by name.

The Brown bands below were measured on the ITC Vol. C 2004 print (not on this table) on 2026-10-01, and the Lisher
bands on Lisher & Forsyth's own Tables 1 and 2 (their nine rare-earth rows), the same day; the probe scripts and
their logs are kept with the verification record, outside this repository.
