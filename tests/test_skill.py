"""The skill tree's format contract (WP-1304).

`docs/skill/rietx/` is the agent-facing document in the open Agent Skills
format: a `SKILL.md` an agent reads whole in one call, reference files loaded
when a task calls for them.  Three things can rot silently here and each has a
test below.

**The caps.**  The document this replaced was 144 427 B, 2.2x the Read tool's
~66 kB cap, so an agent that tried to load it got lines 1-707 and then went
hunting with `grep` and `sed` — five roundtrips for one document, with §7's
diagnostics table never reaching context at all.  A skill body is read *whole*
when the skill activates, so its size is a fixed cost paid by every session
that loads it: `SKILL_MAX_BYTES` is half the Read cap, and `SKILL_MAX_LINES` is
the specification's own recommendation.  `REFERENCE_MAX_BYTES` is the other
tool's limit — Bash output above 40 kB comes back as a 2 kB preview, so a
reference file that a session might `cat` stays under it.

Raising a cap is a decision about every future session's fixed cost.  Make it
in a commit that says so; the fix for a full body is to move a lookup into a
reference file, which is what the tree is for.  The numbers, and the budget
below each that fails only growth (WP-1338), are `tests/skill_caps.py`'s.

**The frontmatter.**  Fields outside the specification are ignored by some
harnesses and rejected by others, so the field *set* is asserted rather than
just the required members.

**The names.**  `references/api.md` is the document three "explore the library"
runs (114 calls) were trying to write from source, and one of them asserted
that everything public is re-exported from the top-level package, which is
false.  So the file is **generated** from the installed package by
`docs/skill/make_api_index.py` — every signature, field and default rendered,
none typed — and pinned byte for byte here, so a rename, a new keyword or a
changed default fails until it is regenerated.  The body's own `report.x` /
`result.x` names, which no generator writes, are walked through the types the
same way the manual's are (`tests/api_surface.attr_step`), and every `rx.X` in
the tree is really exported — the WP-1037 bug's shape, one document over.

# A tag on a row measured outside this repository reads exactly like a citation,
# so #239 put two obligations on it in prose: the file declares the corpus once
# in its provenance line, and every such tag spells it the same way.  Both were
# unchecked -- `.+` in `_EVIDENCE_TAG` is the whole contract, so a row closing
# `*(Measured: some runs I did)*` passed while naming nothing (#241).
#
# **Why the gate requires the complement rather than recognising a repo tag.**
# A repo-shaped tag has no fixed spelling: `WP-\d+` is reliable, but "an eval
# round" and "a dataset in `tests/data/README.md`" are prose, so a pattern for
# them either grows with every new phrasing or starts refusing honest tags.
# Requiring instead that every `Measured` tag opens with `WP-` **or** with the
# declared corpus gives up on validating repo tags -- which the WP files and
# `test_every_dotted_name_in_the_api_index_resolves` already cover from the
# other side -- and spends the whole budget on the private case, which has no
# other guard.  A per-row marker would make the classification trivial and #239
# ruled it out, on the ground that declaring once costs no row an edit; that is
# why the problem cannot simply be designed away.
#
# `Hypothesis` tags name what *would* decide a question rather than a run, so
# they are outside this gate.  A file may hold both kinds, as `batch.md` does
# with two `WP-` tags among 28 private ones, so the gate is per tag, never per
# file.

#: The corpus a file declares for rows measured on data it cannot ship: the one
#: bold span in its provenance paragraph.  Bold is the declaration site because
#: the prose already uses it (`batch.md` § Writing a row says "name the

# --- the hand-written names (#238) ------------------------------------------
#
# `report.regions`, `result.statistics.rwp`, `entry.rungs_tried`,
# `StageResult.held_reach`: field names an author typed, which no generator
# writes.  A rule written against a field that has moved is a rule nobody can
# follow, so each is walked through the types the way the manual's names are.
# Until WP-1338 the walk read the body alone, and the reference files, which
# hold four times its names, were checked by hand at review.
#
# **A root is a variable name or an exported class**, and the two are read
# differently.  A class in `rietx.__all__` is its own root, so a type-level
# claim (`SeriesResult.diagnostics`) is walked with no list to maintain.  A
# variable name is a convention, and some stand for more than one type: in
# `series.md` a `result` is a `SeriesResult`, and in `magnetic.md`
# `report.magnetic` is the module `rietx.report.magnetic`.  So a variable root
# names every type it stands for, and a chain passes when it resolves on one.
# That can pass a field named on the wrong answer type; it cannot pass a field
# that no longer exists on any of them, which is the rot this gate is for.
#
# **What the walk cannot see.**  A negative claim (`StageResult` carries no
# `rwp`) names nothing to resolve, and a field added later falsifies it
# silently; `NEGATIVE_FIELD_CLAIM` below pins the one phrasing the tree uses.
# An attribute a plain class assigns on `self` (`SequentialRefinement.results_`,
# set in `__init__`) has no class-level trace but the source line, so the walk
# accepts it there and stops, the attribute's type being unknown.  A variable
# name outside `_variable_roots()` is not walked:
# `background.` is a report block in one file and a module in another, and
# `phases.0.cell.a` is a parameter path, which `rx.help_for` owns.

# --- the skill's doors -----------------------------------------------------
#
# `tests/api_surface.py` partitions the package's whole call surface against
# the **manual**, whose job is coverage.  The skill is a different document
# with a different denominator: it is a protocol, not a reference, and the
# only names it is obliged to carry are the ones a caller cannot arrive at by
# following an object already in hand.
#
# That set is derived, not listed: the module-level **functions** in
# `rietx.__all__`.  A free verb is the one thing nothing leads to.  A type is
# either returned by a verb — and the index renders its fields where the
# answer is described — or constructed from a class the index already carries
# with its full signature, so an agent holding an `Instrument` reaches its
# constructors through `help(rx.Instrument)`.  Nothing an agent holds leads to
# `read_recipe`, which is why four agents of four, both models, handed a real
# TOPAS `.inp` beside the data it describes, parsed it by hand and never
# called it (WP-1307 round 1.1; `tests/eval_agent_surface/PROTOCOL.md`).
#
# **Documented means named in a generated api index**, not merely somewhere in
# the tree.  `read_recipe` was in `references/diagnostics.md` the whole time,
# inside a `RECIPE_*` row that cannot fire until the door has already been
# used, so a tree-wide test would have called that coverage.  An index is the
# file the routing table names for *"you are about to call rietx: entry
# points"*, and it is generated, so this gate lands on `make_api_index.py`'s
# SECTIONS selection — the thing WP-1306 had no reason to touch when it added
# the `RECIPE_*` rows and shipped the diagnostics without the door.
#
# **A technique nobody's everyday fit uses gets an index of its own**
# (`api-<technique>.md`), and `api.md` stays the everyday one.  The reason is
# the reader's context and not the byte cap: `api.md` is loaded by every
# session that is about to call rietx, so a name only a magnetic refinement
# will ever reach is a cost paid by every session that will never reach it.
# The cap follows from that rather than causing it.  The authored heuristics
# for the same technique stay in their own `references/<technique>.md` under
# the shape rule (root CLAUDE.md § skill) — an authored file and a generated
# index are different objects, and only the generated one is pinned byte for
# byte against `make_api_index.py`.
#
# Deliberately NOT covered, recorded so a later session reads it as a gap and
# not as a decision: alternative constructors (`Instrument.
# flat_plate_transmission`, the seven `RefinementPlan.*` presets).  Thirty of
# the thirty-five are reached another way — a plan by its name string through
# `rx.PLAN_INFO`, a `GuardFinding.*` never by a caller at all — so a partition
# over them would be thirty shrugs, which is the curated list this file exists
# to avoid.
