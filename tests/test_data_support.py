"""Does the data support it: the observation count and the parameter split.

McCusker, Von Dreele, Cox, Louër & Scardi (1999) §9 says the Rietveld
algorithm's N — the number of profile steps — is not the number of
observations, and that only the integrated intensities of individual
reflections are.  Everything here pins that count against something the test
can state independently of the implementation:

* the count is the reflection list **minus what the grid did not measure**, so
  a range end that walks past a reflection steps it down by exactly the number
  of reflections it passed, and an excluded region punched over a peak removes
  that peak whether or not it sits between ``tt_min`` and ``tt_max``;
* a **Kα doublet does not double it** — the ``RefinementResult.ticks`` lesson
  the other way up.  Ticks carry every emission line, and a census that
  counted them would report twice the observations a doublet pattern holds;
* the ratio is against **structural** free parameters, so a plan that refines
  only the profile and the background leaves it undefined rather than
  flattering.

The exact-arithmetic anchor is a **cubic** cell, where (300)/(221) and
(411)/(330) are distinct reflections at identical 2θ.  §9 calls that pair one
observation and the raw count calls it two: the gap this file measures is the
one the effective count exists to close.
