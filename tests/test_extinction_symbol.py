"""WP-1025 — the extinction-symbol screen.

Four kinds of claim, and the first two need no refinement at all:

* **the derivation** — that the classes, the IT-style symbol and the reflection
  conditions come out of the operators rather than out of a table.  Tested by
  census over gemmi's whole space-group table where a table would be tested by
  spot checks, because "derived" is a claim about *every* setting;
* **the shape** — that the answer is a class and a class is a list.  Asserted
  against the type, like ``IndexingResult``'s one rank up: nothing here can
  return one space group, and ``EXTINCTION_GROUPS_NOT_SEPARABLE`` fires whenever
  the leading class holds more than one;
* **the detectors** — that the screen separates a screw axis from its screw-free
  partner, and that a forbidden position carrying intensity refutes its class
  with the hkl named.  Both are measured on a synthetic pattern built from a
  structure that *has* the symmetry, so the absences are physics rather than a
  fixture;
* **the null model** — the measurement that changed the design: on real data the
  same absence test refutes the true class when it is read against the fitted
  background and clears it when read against the class's own calculated pattern.

Every screen here declares its 2θ range explicitly.  The range is part of the
answer — two classes differing only outside it are one class — so inheriting it
from whatever the file happens to contain would make the assertions depend on a
detail the test never states.
