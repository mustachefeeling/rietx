"""WP-1062, retargeted by WP-1066 — an old name is gone, and stays gone.

Two renames now: ``pxrd-refine``/``pxrdref`` → ``anatase`` (WP-1062, ~300
files) → ``rietx`` (WP-1066).  What makes each *finished* rather than merely
done is this test: a reintroduction fails CI instead of depending on a note in
someone's mailbox.

Four things about how it is written are deliberate.

**It greps old tokens, never the current one.**  Not for the reason WP-1062
gave — that reason was about ``anatase`` being ambiguous — but for a plainer
one that holds for any name: the current name is *supposed* to appear, in the
README, in ``_about.py``, in every ``prog=`` string and every
``:func:`~rietx.…``` cross reference, so an audit against it could only ever be
a per-path allowlist of the whole tree.  The price, stated in ``_about.py`` and
unfixable here, is that a freshly hardcoded ``"rietx"`` is invisible to this
test; only the import-it-from-``_about`` rule catches that.

**One of the tokens it greps is domain vocabulary, and that is a dated
liability.**  ``anatase`` is a phase this software analyses.  It appears zero
times as vocabulary today, but ``rutile`` — the other TiO₂ polymorph — appears
~168 times in the QPA test data, and anatase/rutile is the canonical
quantitative-phase-analysis pair.  So the day a fixture or tutorial gains an
anatase phase, that path joins :data:`ALLOWED` with the reason "the TiO₂ phase,
not the old package".  Make that judgement once, deliberately; do not reach for
it to silence a failure that is really a stale reference.  ``pxrd`` never had
this problem — the prose consistently writes "powder X-ray diffraction" — and
``rietx`` cannot acquire it, since the nearest domain word, *Rietveld*, does not
contain the token.

**It greps ``pxt`` too.** The project suffix ``.pxrd`` contains ``pxrd`` and the
first token catches it, but the textdoc magic ``pxt`` does not contain it and
nothing else would ever notice a stale one.  Both were format tokens of the
oldest name, and both were replaced (``.rex``, ``rxt``) rather than rebranded,
because a versioned contract must not move when a brand does — which is why the
second rename left all three format tokens alone and touched only the brand.

**The allowlist is paths, with a reason each.** An allowlist of *lines* would
drift against its own files; an allowlist of paths states which files are
allowed to remember, and there are only three kinds.
