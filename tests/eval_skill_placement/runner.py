"""Build, launch and score the skill-placement round (WP-1338).

    python tests/eval_skill_placement/runner.py build   <root>
    python tests/eval_skill_placement/runner.py prepare <root> <cell>
    python tests/eval_skill_placement/runner.py launch  <root> <cell>
    python tests/eval_skill_placement/runner.py score   <root>
    python tests/eval_skill_placement/runner.py grade   <root>

A **cell** is `<condition>-<model>-<rep>`, e.g. `grep-haiku-2`.  PROTOCOL.md is
the registration: what is asked, what differs between the two conditions, what
is read out and the rule the read-outs are held to.  This module is its
instrument, and `test_placement.py` holds the texts the two share equal.

**The condition is the skill body, and it is installed everywhere the agent can
find one.**  `build` makes one venv per condition from a *wheel* of this tree,
not an editable install, so the package's own copy of the skill sits in
site-packages rather than pointing back at a checkout; under `grep` that copy
is rewritten before `rietx skill --install` copies it into the workspace.  The
maintainer's checkout is still on the machine, so `score` reports every tool
call naming a path inside one (the `leak` column) rather than assuming none.

**Reach is read off what came back, never off what was asked.**  A row is
reached when a tool result holds its table marker, ``| `CODE` |``: a whole-file
Read, a Grep hit and a `sed` of the right lines all return it, and a Read that
stopped short of the row does not.  The marker appears in no other file the
workspace holds, since `fit_output.txt` names each code bare.
