"""The pattern readers: dispatch, the option vocabulary, and what they repair.

Three things are asserted here that nothing else can see once a file is read.

**A repair is only allowed where it can be reported.**  Root CLAUDE.md's rule is
that a silent correction is a reader's to make, and only where the deviation is
a *report* rather than a *contradiction*.  ``ascending`` is that rule applied to
2θ ordering, and the tests below are one per row of its table — including the
two rows that **raise**, which are the load-bearing half: a file whose ranges are
stitched or whose duplicate points disagree has more than one defensible reading,
and picking one silently is exactly what this package refuses.

**A dropped reader option is not the same as a typo'd one.**  The first is
normal (a form carries a value across a change of file) and is reported; the
second is a caller error and raises.  Both are ``reader_options_for``'s.

**A sniff is bounded.**  ``head`` reads a fixed prefix, so the cost of asking ten
formats "is this yours?" does not scale with the pattern.
