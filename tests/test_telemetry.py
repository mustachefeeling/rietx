"""WP-1403 — a fit nobody asked to record records itself.

The premise is a measurement, not a preference. WP-1322 gave three independent
subagents a benchmarking task and no instructions about how to drive rietx; all
three found and read the packaged skill in full, and all three wrote
``history=False``. Reconstructing timing from their own transcripts afterwards
recovered 2.7-16.6 % coverage and nothing from inside a solve. Documenting the
knob harder is the fix that had already been tried, and an agent cannot switch
off by accident what it never had to switch on.

So the assertions here are mostly about what recording must **never** cost:
a fit that carries on when the directory is read-only, a caller's exception
that still reaches them, and a suite that grows no directories at all. The one
positive claim — the four files land and the watcher lists them — is the
acceptance, and it is asserted through ``runs.discover`` rather than by
building paths, because "the watcher lists it" is the thing that was promised.

Recording is **off** for the suite (``conftest``), so every test that wants it
takes the ``recording`` fixture. ``test_the_suite_itself_records_nothing`` is
the meta-test for the other direction: without it the suite would grow hundreds
of run directories the first time somebody changed the default.
