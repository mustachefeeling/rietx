"""HIGH_CORRELATION deduplication and the per-fit cap (WP-1302).

Mostly unit-level: the mechanism is pure list processing over ``Diagnostic``
objects, and a persistently correlated real pair
(``tests/test_capillary_displacement.py``,
``tests/test_acceptance_lab6_cbn.py``) is expensive to reproduce on every run
just to re-check dedup arithmetic already covered here.

**One real fit at the end, and it covers what none of the unit tests can**
(WP-1310): that the stage loop still routes correlations through the dedup at
all.  ``_run_plan`` treats ``HIGH_CORRELATION`` unlike every other code — it
collects into ``correlation_hits`` rather than extending ``diagnostics`` — so
losing that branch restores issue #106 in full with every unit test below
still green.  0.27 s, which is what makes it affordable here rather than in
the slow selection.
