"""WP-1020 — the Q-space core: the quadratic form, the subspaces, the FoM panel.

Three of these tests are the WP's own acceptance criteria and are written to fail
loudly rather than drift:

* the **derived** metric-subspace dimensions must equal the cell degrees of
  freedom ``params.vector`` has tabulated since v0.1 — the derivation has to
  reproduce the tabulation, or one of the two is wrong;
* recovery of (A..F) from true assignments must be **exact** (1e-10), which is
  the linearity claim the whole design rests on, checked rather than asserted;
* a **paired** figure-of-merit test: M₂₀ is invariant under a unimodular setting
  change, and F_N is explicitly *not* invariant under a zero shift.  The second
  half turns a documented blind spot into a tested one, which is the only way a
  blind spot stays true.
