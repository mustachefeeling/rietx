"""Capillary sample displacement, McCusker et al. (1999) §5 eq (4) — WP-1073.

Three things are checked, and only the first is about the formula.

**The expression, against a ray trace rather than against the paper.** Eq (4)
is printed as (x·sin2θ − y·cos2θ)/R with no figure, and the letters do not
travel: other codes pair the letter x with the *other* term.  So the test that
matters is not "does the code transcribe the paper" but "does the shift equal
the angle a displaced capillary actually produces", and that is answered by
intersecting the diffracted ray with the detector circle exactly and reading
the angle at the goniometer centre.  Nothing is shared between that and the
implementation but the geometry itself — the WP-0501 lesson (a transcribed
constant with two digits swapped survived every comparison against its own
source) applied to a sign convention.

**Recovery, on a pattern that genuinely carries the displacement** — the
offsets go into the specimen the data is simulated from, not into a starting
model, so a refinement has to find them rather than merely stay where it was
put.  Both axes at once, because either alone is a weaker claim than the pair:
{1, sin2θ, cos2θ} is a near-degenerate trio at short range and the point is
that a wide scan separates it.

**Real 11-BM data**, where the WP's own premise did not survive
measurement.  It expected a *null* test — the paper says a crystal analyser
eliminates displacement error, so 11-BM should recover x, y ≈ 0.  It does not.
Over NAC's certified 2-24° range the three positional shapes are degenerate
(unit-column Gram eigenvalue 1.6e-5), so the fit slides along the null
direction to a bound and returns +1.00 and +0.72 mm with esds of 2.8 and
1.0 mm — while Rwp *improves* and the cell leaves its acceptance band by
1117 ppm.  What the last two tests assert is therefore the sharper claim: on
this instrument the correction must not be refined, and the package says so
in the channel that can (esds, HIGH_CORRELATION, BOUND_HIT) rather than in
the one that cannot (Rwp).

Those two are **not** marked ``slow`` even though they read a real dataset.
The mark exists for the acceptance suites, whose fits cost minutes; both NAC
fits here take 2.9 s together, and they skip cleanly where the file is
absent, so the fast gate is where this evidence is worth having.

    the number it qualifies.

    Asserted here as the *machinery reporting it*, because that is the part a
    consumer relies on: the offsets come back unquotable against their own
    esds, ``HIGH_CORRELATION`` names one of them, and ``BOUND_HIT`` fires.
    Both flavours of "not measured" are allowed — which of the two the solver
    reaches is a path property, and pinning it would make this a test of the
    trust region.
