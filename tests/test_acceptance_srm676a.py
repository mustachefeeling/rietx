"""v0.3 acceptance: lab corundum against the NIST SRM 676a certified cell.

The certificate (04 Nov 2015 issue; lattice values 23 Apr 2012) is the
**absolute anchor**: a = 4.759355 ± 0.000080 Å, c = 12.99231 ± 0.00015 Å at
22.5 °C (k = 2), on the Hölzer (1997) Cu Kα1 wavelength scale — the same
scale the ``CuKa`` instrument preset ships.  Two honesty caveats, both from
the WP-0310 brief:

* NIST publishes **no raw 676a pattern**, so the fit runs on the IUCr
  round-robin's pure-corundum lab pattern (``qarr/corundum.prn``), whose
  provenance is *not* documented as SRM 676a.  It stands in as a lab corundum
  *specimen*; the certified cell anchors the comparison, not the specimen's
  identity.
* On an ordinary Bragg-Brentano pattern the {zero, displacement, cell} triple
  is decorrelated only by *holding* a certified cell (the ``lab_calibrate``
  lesson), which is exactly what a cell-accuracy test cannot do.  The
  practical absolute tolerance is therefore lab-realistic (6×10⁻⁴ relative),
  nowhere near the certificate's ~17 ppm, and the sharp certificate-grade
  assertion is the **axial ratio c/a** — uniform d-scale systematics (zero,
  displacement, wavelength convention) cancel in it, so it survives lab data
  unharmed.  The same shape-vs-magnitude reasoning as the v0.2 FAP test.

The certificate's other value — crystalline mass fraction 99.02 ± 1.11 %
(k = 2) — is an *amorphous* quantity, certified against an external silicon
series.  Amorphous/internal-standard quantification is a v2 fence and a
WP-0310 non-goal: ``RefinementResult.qpa`` reports fractions of the modelled
crystalline content (≡ 1 for a single phase, asserted below), and this suite
does not claim to test the 99.02 %.

**Measured result** (2026-07-24, recorded in docs/milestones/v0.3.md):
Rwp = 14.4 %, GoF = 1.61; a = 4.757866 Å (−313 ppm), c = 12.988632 Å
(−283 ppm), the two axes offset by the same relative amount (Δ within
3×10⁻⁵) ⇒ a uniform d-scale systematic of this uncalibrated instrument —
while **c/a = 2.729928 lands +30 ppm** from the certificate's 2.729846.
Refined Kα2/Kα1 = 0.43 (the graphite passband clips the 0.5 emission ratio),
Biso(Al) = 0.23, Biso(O) = 0.22 Å² — both physical.


Dispersion is **declined**, inherited from ``qarr_instrument`` in
``test_acceptance_qpa_roundrobin``.  WP-1001 measured what the (now default)
block does to this suite's certificate-grade assertion and it is safe either
way — c/a moves +29.8 → +30.2 ppm against a 100 ppm bar — but Rwp rises
14.374 → 14.531 % and Biso(Al) 0.232 → 0.314 Å², so the recorded numbers below
are dispersion-off ones and say so.

# angles at their stored value, removing the single angular degree of freedom
# the setting has.  The free-parameter count was 2 either way, so nothing

    A dummy atom carries no structure — exactly the indexing validator's device
    — which is what makes this a clean test of the cell ties: the rhombohedral
    *atomic* coordinates never enter, so they cannot be got wrong and confound
    the comparison.  Stage order follows ``validation_plan``: ``w`` before the
    other width terms, because it is the only one non-zero at 2θ = 0.

    The (profile, cell) round repeats until the descent flattens, and that is
    load-bearing rather than thorough (measured 2026-08-17, darwin/arm64).  With
    one round the two arms of the test below stop at Rwp 0.1499524 having agreed
    to 1.2e-8 in c — but they agree because they are still on a *coincident*
    path, not because the lattice says so.  The next round splits them
    (0.146059 against 0.144896) and they settle 7.4e-5 apart at 0.1419093 and
    0.1419837, flat to ~1e-8 from round six on.  A Linux runner's rhombohedral
    arm splits a little differently, so the one-round coincidence held on darwin
    and broke there, and the bar below was widened twice chasing it before
    anyone plotted the descent (runs 31973603220, 32001934722, 32008985488).
    Twelve rounds costs 3.4 s per arm and puts both arms at a stationary point,
