"""The package's public call surface, **derived** from the live package (WP-1067).

This is the enumeration the WP-1003 freeze covers, and the denominator the
user manual's coverage partition is asserted against
(`tests/test_manual_api.py`).  It is deliberately not a hand-written list.

**Why derived.** A list nobody regenerates cannot notice a *new* public
method: it never enters the denominator, the coverage partition stays green,
and coverage silently drops.  That is `_SURFACE_FLAGS` one level up —
``features["indexing"]`` was ``False`` for its entire life because a
hand-written name (``index``) and the real export (``index_pattern``) drifted
apart while the meta-test asserted the flag's own expression rather than the
name (WP-1037).  So the names are data read out of the package, and the only
hand-written halves are the exclusions below, each carrying a reason.

**Why not ``rietx.__all__``.** It is the right set of *entry points* and the
wrong denominator for a manual: almost nothing a user calls lives there.
``ref.fit``, ``ref.parameters``, ``result.statistics.rwp``,
``history.branch``/``merge``/``cherry_pick``, ``Project.create``/``open``/
``save`` are members and fields.  A manual naming ``Refinement`` once would
satisfy an ``__all__`` partition and document nothing.

Two derivation rules carry the weight, both measured 2026-08-14:

1. **"Public member" means declared, not inherited.**  34 of the 47 exported
   classes are pydantic models, so a bare ``dir()`` denominator is 1099 names,
   most of them ``model_dump``-class ``BaseModel`` machinery.  A member counts
   iff it is one of the model's own fields, or the class that *defines* it
   lives in a ``rietx`` module.  A member is attributed to its **defining**
   class, so a method a subclass inherits from a rietx base is one entry, not
   two.
2. **The surface closes over reachable unexported types.**  ``Statistics`` is
   not exported, so one level of attributes never reaches
   ``result.statistics.rwp`` — the manual's own motivating example.  The
   closure follows fields and public-method annotations of types already on
   the surface, and the signatures of exported functions: ``capabilities()``
   returns a ``Capabilities``, which is exported nowhere.  Exporting those
   types instead would be new public API, which WP-1067 forbids itself.
3. **A plain class's members are assigned, not declared.**  ``dir()`` on the
   *class* cannot see ``self.history = …`` in ``__init__``, so
   ``Refinement.history``, ``Project.doc`` and 25 others were missing until
   the manual's own guard rejected the first of them as a name that does not
   resolve.  Instance attributes are read off the class's source with ``ast``.

**The tier a name is on is data too** (WP-1078).  A documented name is frozen
from the release that documents it, which is the wrong promise for a subsystem
still under development, so ``PROVISIONAL_MODULES`` declares one by **module
prefix** and ``provisional_names()`` resolves it against each name's *defining*
module.  Declared, derived and one edit wide: a new type in a declared module
is provisional the moment it is written, and a rename that empties a
declaration fails rather than leaving a dead promise behind.

Run ``python -m tests.api_surface`` for a summary of the surface, or
``python -m tests.api_surface --write-deferred`` to regenerate
``api_surface_deferred.txt`` (see `tests/test_manual_api.py` for what that
file is and why it is generated rather than typed).

# The third tier (WP-1078).  A name Part 1 documents is frozen from the
# release that documents it, and for a subsystem still under active
# development that is the wrong promise: `using/indexing.md` froze the whole
# indexing surface the day it landed, and WP-1077 then had to change what one
# of those names *answers* in a patch release.  So a subsystem can be declared
# provisional, which overrides the documented tier for its names and nothing
# else.
#
# Keyed by **module prefix**, and resolved against each name's *defining*
# module, for the reason `_SURFACE_FLAGS` exists (WP-1037): a hand-written
# list of names and the real exports drift apart while the test asserts the
# list.  Defining rather than exporting is what reaches
# `determine_extinction_symbol`, which is re-exported at top level and
# documented under that name.  A new type in one of these modules is
# provisional the moment it is written.
#
# `test_manual_api.py` fails on an entry here that matches nothing, so a
# module rename cannot leave a dead declaration behind, and on a provisional
# name that no chapter documents: provisional is a weaker *promise*, never
# thinner coverage.
#
# What is deliberately NOT here: `rietx.capabilities`.
# `Capabilities.indexing_thresholds_version` and the engine and preset
# capability types are data contracts with their own version strings, and a
# consumer that parses an answer keeps its hard freeze.  The risk is the
# caller's who imports a type, not the reader's of a response.  (`rietx.agent`
# was the second name on this line until WP-1303 deleted it.)

# --- the internal sentence, and what WP-1003 filed under it ---------------
#
# **Anything importable outside the derived surface is internal and may
# change without notice.**  That sentence is normative (the compatibility
# page states it to users); this note records the families ruled internal at
# the freeze so a later session exporting one of them knows it is reopening
# a decision, not filling a gap:
#
# - `rietx.backend` (WP-0401): `Backend`, `get_backend`, `set_backend`,
#   `resolve_backend`, `MixedPrecisionPolicy`, the traced twin.  The public
#   route is `fit(backend=...)`; `set_backend` is process-wide mutable state
#   and says so in its docstring.
# - `rietx.model` helpers (1071, 1072): the compiled model's members are
#   dropped with the `CompiledModel` exclusion above; `model.geometry`'s
#   computation (neighbour search, covariance propagation) is internal and
#   its *output* is the surface (`GeometryTable`, reached from the result).
# - `rietx.crystallography` (1018 and before): symmetry/wyckoff/stephens
#   machinery.  Consumed through `ParameterTable` and the schemas; the
#   authorities named in CLAUDE.md (`cell_constraints`, `adp_basis`, …) are
#   authorities over *this package's* behaviour, not exports.
#
# These names are not entries in the tables above because an exclusion must
# be live on the unfiltered surface (`test_exclusions_are_live_and_reasoned`)
# and none of them reaches it — they are internal by the sentence alone.
