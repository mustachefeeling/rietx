"""The time-of-flight forward model: the physics, and both arms of each claim.

Every fixture here is **synthetic and written in this file**.  No line of any
real instrument file is in the repository; the real-data measurements that
motivated these bars (LANSCE NPDF, SNS NOMAD, ISIS GEM) live in the rung's
report, and where one of them set a number below, the docstring says so.

The residual is driven by ``scipy.optimize.least_squares`` directly rather than
through ``Refinement``: this rung proves the forward model, and a refinement
harness between the two would make a failure ambiguous.
