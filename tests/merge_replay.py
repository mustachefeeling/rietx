"""Where merges conflict, and whether WP bookkeeping still touches ROADMAP (WP-1507).

    python -m tests.merge_replay SINCE [UNTIL]

Two reports over a window of history, both read from git alone.

**The replay.**  Every two-parent merge in ``git log --merges --all`` is
recomputed with ``git merge-tree --write-tree``, which exits 1 on a conflict
and names the paths.  It runs twice.  The first run merges the WP index as
plain text, which is what GitHub's web merge does.  The second runs the
``wpindex`` driver, which is what a local sync does: merge-tree runs a
configured driver (measured 2026-09-27 on git 2.39).  The counts are a floor,
since a rebase leaves no merge behind to replay.  WP-1507's baseline is this
replay over 2026-08-15 to 2026-09-27: 25 conflicted merges, 17 of them on
docs/ROADMAP.md.

**Header changes.**  A first-parent commit on origin/main whose diff touches
docs/wp/README.md changed some WP's header: a filing, a claim, a close or a
re-rating.  WP-1507's acceptance is that none of them touches docs/ROADMAP.md
or tests/test_docs_consistency.py.  One that does is listed for a person to
judge, because opening a new ROADMAP track is a legitimate reason.
