"""WP-1012 — from a typed suggestion to the verbs that carry it out.

Two halves, and the split is the point.  The **mapping** is pure: which of the
sixteen ``ActionKind`` members is a button, what stage a button runs, and why a
non-button is not one — all answerable without a fit, so they are asserted
against hand-built :class:`SuggestedAction` objects, including the four kinds no
report currently emits as a primary suggestion (they exist only in
``alternatives`` today, and a table that covers them has to be checked somewhere).

The **apply** half is driven over real HTTP against one real refinement, because
the claims are about what happens to the project: one history node, χ² actually
measured against the prediction, and undo being a ``checkout`` rather than an
inverse verb.  The fixture deliberately fits a *narrow* plan (scale, background,
two profile widths) on a model whose cell is 0.0005 Å off — small enough to stay
inside the linearisation radius so Layer 1 does not abstain, and outside the
plan so the strategy veto does not cover it.  Everything the report says about
that project is a measurement, not a construction: ``refine_scale`` comes back
vetoed because the plan already refines it, and the two Bragg-Brentano geometry
actions come back *unreachable* because this is a Debye-Scherrer instrument.
