"""Shim tracer for the agent-surface round (WP-1110 round 1.0; WP-1307 round 1.1).

Installed into the *experiment* venv's site-packages (never into the package
under test) by a ``.pth`` line, so every interpreter that venv starts is traced
no matter how an agent invokes it.  It records which public rietx entry points a
run actually reached -- the round's whole read-out -- so the condition is
enforced by the environment rather than asked for in a prompt.

One JSONL line per event, appended with O_APPEND so concurrent runs interleave
safely.  Round 1.1 gives **each run its own venv with its own log path baked
in**, which is what makes attribution a property of the environment instead of
an inference from which file a process happened to touch; ``RIETX_SURFACE_LOG``
stays as a fallback and is not how a 1.1 run is attributed.

Three things a reader of the log has to know, all declared in PROTOCOL.md 1.1:

* **A row is written when the call returns**, carrying ``dt``, its elapsed
  seconds, and ``ok``.  A process killed mid-call therefore leaves no row for
  it, which is the price of timing the call at all.
* **``depth`` is how deep the call sat inside other traced calls**, and it is
  load-bearing rather than decorative: ``rx.refine`` *is* ``Refinement.fit`` one
  frame down, and ``refine_sequential`` *is* ``SequentialRefinement.fit``, so
  summing seconds over names double-counts every fit unless the sum is taken at
  ``depth == 0``.
* **Keyword names always, values only from ``_VALUE_KWARGS``** -- an enum, a
  bool or a preset name, never user data.  Three of the round's read-outs turn
  on *which* value was passed rather than on whether a keyword was.
