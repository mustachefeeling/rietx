"""The wavelength–cell degeneracy fence, and the parameter path behind it.

Fast tests over synthetic two-histogram fixtures.  The real-data acceptance —
the published joint refinement this feature exists for — is
``tests/test_acceptance_wavelength.py``.

Two halves.  The first is the **refusal**: for one histogram λ and the cell are
exactly degenerate (Bragg's law fixes only λ/2d), so a free λ is refused; for N
histograms of one specimen the shared cell breaks the degeneracy, so exactly one
held and at most N − 1 free is admitted and everything else is refused, each
case naming its own cause.  The second is the **wiring**: a parameter registered
in ``_collect_instrument`` and forgotten in ``apply_to_models`` loses its
refined value at the next recompile without failing anything, which is the
failure mode ``params/vector.py``'s own comment warns about, and a neutron
source is where it would happen — ``NeutronSource.lines`` is a property that
builds a fresh ``EmissionLine`` per access.
