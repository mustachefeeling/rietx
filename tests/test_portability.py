"""WP-1002 — the portability rules that only a non-POSIX platform can break.

These are source guards, not behaviour tests: they parse the tree and fail on a
construct, because the failure they prevent is invisible on the platform this
package is developed on.  Both encode something measured on a Windows runner
rather than something assumed.

**Text I/O must name its encoding.**  ``Path.read_text()`` and ``open()`` use
``locale.getpreferredencoding(False)``, which is UTF-8 on macOS and Linux and
**cp1252 on Windows** (measured: the runner reports ``preferred encoding:
cp1252``, ``stdout encoding: cp1252``).  So a file this package writes as UTF-8
on one platform is read back as mojibake — or raises ``UnicodeDecodeError`` —
on another.  Six of the seven failures in the first Windows run were exactly
this, every one of them ``'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x81``.  Python
3.15 makes UTF-8 the default and retires the problem, but the supported range
here starts at 3.11.

**CSV must be written through ``newline=""``.**  ``csv.writer`` emits ``\\r\\n``
per the spec; writing that string through text mode translates each ``\\n``
again, so every line ends ``\\r\\r\\n`` — a file with a blank line between every
row.  That was the seventh failure, and a real one: ``write_qpa_table``
produced corrupt CSV on Windows while its sibling ``write_reflection_table``,
which already opened with ``newline=""``, did not.

**A POSIX-only import is guarded or it is a collection error.**  WP-1439: the
run-recording track put a bare ``import fcntl`` at the top of
``tests/test_runs.py``, so on Windows that module did not import and its 51
cases went unrun behind a single ``error`` line.  The package had guarded the
same import at all three of its own sites, which is exactly why nothing looked
wrong.  A guarded import degrades to a skip; an unguarded one takes the file.

**A write handle names its newline.**  WP-1439 again, and the CSV rule one
case over.  ``csv.writer`` emits its own ``\r\n`` and so wants ``newline=""``;
a JSONL writer emits its own ``\n`` and wants ``newline="\n"``.  Left to text
mode, every JSONL file this package writes is CRLF on Windows and LF
everywhere else — the same events at a different size and a different
checksum, which is what ``history.jsonl`` being part of a ``.rex`` project
makes a contract question rather than a cosmetic one.  The rule is on
``open`` and not on ``write_text``: a handle is what lines are written
through, while ``write_text`` puts a whole document down in one call.  Seven
sites in the tree, all of them JSONL but the lock file.

The guards parse rather than grep because the calls that matter span lines —
the multi-line ``write_text(json.dumps({...}), encoding="utf-8")`` in
``viz/live.py`` is invisible to a line-based search, which is how one site
survived the first sweep.
