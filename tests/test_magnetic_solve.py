"""`solve_magnetic`: the determination workflow, its criterion and its abstentions.

M-9.  Everything here is **synthetic** — the pattern is simulated from a
structure this file states, so the answer is known and a wrong ranking is a
failure rather than a disagreement with a tutorial.  The one real-data arm the
tree carries data for, Cr₂WO₆ at 4 K and 150 K, is
``test_magnetic_solve_acceptance.py``.

The tests worth having are the ones a *plausible wrong* implementation fails,
so each block below turns on something specific:

* the k step takes the **forbidden-lattice-point** route when that bucket
  fires, and never scores that excess against a candidate vector — a k = 0
  signature fed to the candidate ranking is the first way this workflow goes
  quietly wrong;
* the ranking is **not** Rwp: a family with more amplitudes reaches a lower Rwp
  and must still lose when BIC charges it for them;
* one trial per **equivalence class**, not per candidate — the count of fits is
  the assertion, because a workflow that refines every member produces the same
  table with a different bill and no visible difference;
* a **tie is an abstention**, and the abstention names every member of it;
* the null test is a **gate**: a pattern with no magnetic intensity produces no
  winner, whatever ΔBIC says;
* a **non-neutron histogram is refused by name**;
* the magnetic-only R is computed over the channels the nuclear model puts
  nothing on and nowhere else, which is what makes it comparable between
  candidates;
* a class with **more than one magnetic site** is refined from every one-site
  start as well as the flat one, because the flat unit-magnitude seed can land
  in a minimum that is provably not the optimum, and a ranking taken at
  non-optimal points measures the seed;
* every glob the default stages free actually frees something — a ``Stage``
  entry matching nothing is accepted silently.
