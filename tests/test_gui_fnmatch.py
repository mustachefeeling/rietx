"""WP-1011 — the glob fixture the frontend's matcher is held to.

The GUI's parameter table previews a bulk free/fix before sending it, which
means a matcher in TypeScript deciding what a Python glob selects.  Two matchers
for one vocabulary is a drift hazard with no natural alarm: the preview would
say 41 and the server would free 214, and nothing would fail.

So the authority is written down.  This module regenerates
``tests/data/gui/fnmatch_cases.json`` from :func:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase` — the
function ``ParameterTable.set_vary`` itself calls — over a **live** parameter
vocabulary, and ``gui/src/lib/fnmatch.test.ts`` replays every case through
``lib/fnmatch.ts``.  The fixture is committed because vitest must run without
pytest having run first (a CI job that installs node does not install this
package), so the check here is the same shape as the dist digest in
``test_gui_dist.py``: regenerate, compare, and fail *naming the command* when
they differ.

The vocabulary is live rather than a literal list for the reason every registry
meta-test in this repo exists: a path shape nobody thought of — ``adp.0``,
``microstrain.dof.3``, ``source.lines.1.weight`` — is exactly the one a hand-written
corpus omits and a grouping rule mishandles.
