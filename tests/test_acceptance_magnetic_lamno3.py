"""WP-1327 acceptance, second dataset: the LaMnO₃ moment at 50 K, k = 0.

One BT-1 pattern (NIST reactor, Cu(311) monochromator, λ = 1.5403 Å) from the
GSAS-II tutorial *Magnetic-I*, vendored verbatim with the tutorial's structure
file (``tests/data/README.md``).  Every line indexes on the nuclear P n m a
cell, so the propagation vector is zero and the moment model is a magnetic
space group on that cell.  The tutorial's k-SUBGROUPSMAG step finds two
groups that index every line and let Mn carry a moment: Pn′ma′ (BNS 62.448)
and Pnma (BNS 62.441).  The protocol is the tutorial's where rietx can state
it:

1. nuclear only, from the tutorial's CIF, over its Step 2 Limits of
   6-156° 2θ, with the contaminant line at 15.69° excluded as its Step 7
   suggests: scale + 6 Chebyshev → zero → cell → u, v, w, x → coordinate
   DOFs → B_iso, cumulative.  This is the negative control;
2. Mn³⁺ carrying a moment under each group in turn, warm-started from (1):
   moment + scale + background, then everything.

The tutorial holds My at zero because the strong first line, (010), is
magnetic, and seeds Mx and Mz at 1.  Here the moment is seeded at
(1, 0, 1) μ_B and refines through its modulus and polar angle with the
azimuth held, which is the same hold: the azimuth is what moves a moment out
of the a-c plane.  The tutorial picks Pn′ma′ because it fits the pair of
lines at 33.3° and 34.4° 2θ and Pnma does not.  It quotes no moment, and no
other reference is to hand, so the suite asserts the *shape* of the answer:
a supported moment along **a**, below Mn³⁺'s spin-only ceiling, that removes
half the nuclear-only misfit, and a Pn′ma′ fit that beats the Pnma one at
that pair.

**The instrument** is taken from ``gsas2_bt1_cu311.inst`` by hand.
``read_gsas_prm`` refuses the file, since its bank's first profile is GSAS
type 1, so λ comes from the ``ICONS`` line and the Gaussian widths from the
type-3 profile, converted by the measured convention
``io.recipe.GAUSS_CENTIDEG2_TO_DEG2`` (a GSAS variance in centideg² to a
Caglioti FWHM² in deg²).  The file's Lorentzian terms are zero, which a
softplus width cannot start from, so ``x`` keeps the builder's seed.

**Dispersion** is not a choice here: a neutron source has no ``dispersion``
channel (``NeutronSource`` carries one wavelength and no f′/f″).  The
convergence schedule is declared explicitly, ``intermediate_ftol=1e-6``, the
shipped value and the Cr₂WO₆ suite's.
