"""λ/n monochromator harmonics: the schema, the two shared facts, the fit.

The fast tests here are the ones that would pass for a source with *any* second
emission line, so each turns on something that is specific to a **harmonic** —
that its wavelength is derived rather than stored, that the reflection list has
to be generated for it and not for the fundamental, that one |F|² still serves
both lines, and that declaring none leaves the model bit-identical.

The real-data case is the **published** histogram: the λ/2 second-order
contribution on the NIST BT-1 Cu(311) monochromator is stated in the paper's
own experimental section — "a Cu(311) monochromator was used, with a constant
wavelength of λ = 1.5402(2) Å and a second-order contribution at λ/2"
(Gaultois et al., *J. Phys.: Condens. Matter*, 2013) — so the contamination is
a cited property of this exact measurement rather than something inferred from
the fit that models it.  Its evidence is **GoF**, never Rwp: the λ/2 peaks are
extra intensity where the model puts none, which GoF sees against σ and Rwp
(dominated by the strong peaks) does not.

The negative control is **synthetic** on purpose.  A second real histogram from
a harmonic-free monochromator would still rest on believing that it is
harmonic-free; a simulated single-wavelength pattern is one where the absence is
a fact of construction.  So the control declares a λ/2 line on a pattern that
provably contains no λ/2 intensity and requires the weight to refine to nothing
— which is the failure mode that would matter, a line that buys χ² from the
background whenever it is offered.
