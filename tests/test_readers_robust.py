"""What the readers do to files that are *wrong*, not merely unfamiliar.

Every reader in this package is handed bytes somebody else wrote — increasingly
so, since the vendor formats are containers (zip members, XML trees, binary TLV
segments) written by instrument software this project does not own.  A container
parser's natural failure mode is its *library's* exception: ``struct.error``,
``zipfile.BadZipFile``, ``ET.ParseError``.  None of those is a
``ValueError``/``OSError``, and ``ET.ParseError`` subclasses ``SyntaxError``, so
one escaping a reader is a traceback on an API caller and a 500 on the GUI's
upload route rather than "this file could not be read".

So there is one cross-cutting invariant, asserted here rather than trusted:

    **a reader raises ``ValueError`` or ``OSError``, and names the file.**

The harness that earns its keep is truncation — the cheapest way to produce a
file that is *structurally* broken at an arbitrary depth rather than merely
odd, which is what a half-finished copy, an interrupted download and a
network-mounted instrument share drive all produce for real.

#: Formats with **no vendorable real file**, built here instead.  Kept apart from
#: the list above rather than mixed into it, because a synthesized file exercises
#: the parser's failure paths and says nothing about the format: it is written
#: from the same understanding the reader was, so the two agree by construction.
#: ``.uxd`` is here because every obtainable real one is GPL or carries no
#: licence at all; ``.rasx`` for a different reason — a real one is vendored and
#: truncated above, but the only real *multi-scan* archive is 2.3 MB, so the
#: several-groups failure paths are reached synthetically
#: (``tests/data/README.md`` names both).  ``raw4`` is here for a third reason
#: again — a real one *is* vendored and truncated above, but it holds one range,
#: and a cut through the second range of a two-range file is a different depth
#: to fail at: the first range has already parsed and returned by then.
#: ``raw3`` is the plainest case: **no** real file exists, from any source, so
#: this arm is the only truncation coverage that format has.
#: ``gsas_esd`` is a fifth reason: a real ESD bank *is* vendored and truncated
#: above (``mg090.Cu311.gsas``), but the ESD field's failure mode only appears
#: once a value **fills** all eight of its characters, and no vendored bank has
#: one — ``mg090.Cu311.gsas`` peaks at 14 476 written without decimals
#: (``14476.``, six characters).  The APS 11-BM patterns that do reach the edge
#: are not redistributable (``tests/data/README.md`` § GSAS ESD), so the layout
#: is packed here instead.
#: ``udf`` is a sixth reason: a vendorable fixture *does* exist (PyXRD's inline
#: one, BSD-2) but it is 33 points and five keys, so cutting it reaches almost
#: none of the header; all 56 real files are unlicensed, so the full 19-key
#: header is synthesized here from the table in ``tests/data/README.md``.
#: ``philips_v5`` is the ``raw3`` case exactly: a real **V3** ``.rd`` is
#: vendored and truncated above, but **no V5 file exists anywhere**, and V5's
#: header is 810 bytes against V3's 250 — so a cut lands at depths the V3 file
#: cannot reach, and this arm is the only truncation coverage that version has.
