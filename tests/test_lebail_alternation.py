"""WP-1323: the Le Bail alternation has a stop rule, and the package owns it.

The pattern is 11-BM LaB6 + cBN, Le Bail scaffolds, ``profile_only``.  It is the
in-tree stand-in for issue #210's multi-phase lab pattern.  It shows three
shapes depending on where the cells start.  At +0.3 % pass 2 comes back *worse*
than pass 1.  At +0.4 % the passes converge.  At +2 % they never settle.

The fast tests fit 5.1-25° (``LIMITS``), under half the range the hand loop
used, and a fit costs a quarter to a fifth of one at 5.1-50° (WP-1547).  The
three shapes hold there.  The converging one starts at -0.15 %, because +0.4 %
sits on an edge at 5.1-25°: WP-1936's step for ``u`` and ``v`` turns it into a
worse-pass start.  -0.15 % converges with or without that step on macOS, and
without it on Linux.  How many passes it takes depends on the platform, so its
test asserts the shape and not the count.  A start of +0.6 % or more diverges at
5.1-25° whatever the
loop does.  Every Rwp the fast tests pin was measured at 5.1-25°.  The one
``slow`` test keeps 5.1-50° (``WIDE_LIMITS``), where its pins were measured.

At 5.1-50° the per-pass numbers were re-measured in WP-1930.  Its floor seed
started ``instrument.profile.y`` off its softplus floor, where it had stayed,
and every pass came down by about 3 percentage points of Rwp: the exact cells'
pass 1 read 16.821 % before and 14.220 % after.

The tests that only read a fit share it through a module fixture, each pinned
to one worker by its ``xdist_group``.  A history, a run directory and an event
callback each leave the fit bit-identical: Rwp and every parameter were equal
with and without them at +0.3 % and +0.4 % (WP-1547).
