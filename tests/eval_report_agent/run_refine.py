"""The agent's only sanctioned call path into a refinement (WP-1053).

It called the package's JSON envelope until WP-1303 retired that; the request
and response shapes are unchanged, because they were always this protocol's
rather than the package's, and :func:`run_request` below now runs them against
``Refinement.fit`` directly.

The shim, not the prompt, enforces the condition — an agent can ignore a
prompt; it cannot un-strip a response:

- the request is always ``episode.json`` (fixed) plus ``overlay.json``
  restricted to ``plan`` / ``mode`` / ``two_theta_limits`` — the agent
  structurally cannot touch the pattern or the starting parameter values;
- ``include_report`` and ``include_trajectory`` come from the **sibling**
  condition marker (``<episode_dir>.condition.json`` — outside the
  workspace, PROTOCOL.md 2.0), never from the agent: they are set on the
  request (so the package never builds what this condition withholds) **and**
  popped from the response (so a package default can never leak one back in);
- the 2.2 projections come from the same marker (PROTOCOL.md 2.2):
  ``license_placement: "statistics"`` moves the identifiability clause from
  ``report.summary`` into ``result.statistics["identifiability_clause"]``
  (one renderer, byte-exact excision, loud failure), and
  ``include_execution: false`` pops WP-1106's ``execution`` from every
  delivered action — response *shape*, not withholding, and both inert when
  the report is withheld.  Since WP-1108 the *package* delivers the
  statistics field itself (``build_report``'s declared write), so on a real
  response the projection's injection half is a checked no-op — a shipped
  field disagreeing with the re-render fails the call — and the excision is
  what still constructs the round's *moved* shape (the package ships the
  copy).  A ``"summary"`` marker on a real response is therefore historical:
  it delivers 1.2's summary placement *plus* the shipped field, and a future
  round wanting a field-free arm must add a strip projection;
- every call is appended to ``calls.jsonl`` (the record the scorer and the
  call count come from, never the agent's self-report), with the bulk curve
  arrays elided — the fit is deterministic from episode + overlay, so the
  curves are reproducible, and what the agent saw is exactly what was logged.
  The log lives in the workspace, so it carries **no condition echo** — in
  1.1 each record repeated ``condition``/``include_report``/
  ``include_trajectory``, which was the same leak as the in-dir marker; the
  delivered response shape is itself the auditable evidence;
- calls beyond ``max_calls`` are refused (a runaway guard, never a timer),
  and a refused call is logged but does not count against the budget.
