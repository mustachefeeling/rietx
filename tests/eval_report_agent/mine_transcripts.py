"""Mine a kept agent-eval record for what the agents actually read (WP-1063).

Round 2 graded *outcomes* (``scorer.py``) and left the mechanism to be read
out of thirty transcripts by hand.  This reads it deterministically instead,
around the distinction the outcome grid could not make:

- **probed** — the agent's own query names a field (the ``jq`` or ``python -c``
  that reaches into ``response['report']['identifiability']``).  Going to look.
- **delivered** — the field's text came back in a tool result, i.e. entered the
  agent's context.  Having it.
- **voiced** — the agent's own prose names it: assistant text blocks, and the
  ``answer.json`` it wrote.  Saying it.

The three come apart, and that is the point.  An agent that never printed the
identifiability section was never misled by the exchange clause; one that
printed it and never mentioned it was not persuaded by it; and a trajectory
nobody probed was paid for and unread.  Two caveats ride with every count
here and belong in any sentence quoting them:

- **quoting is reading, not benefiting** (round 1: E7 quoted the report
  verbatim and was wrong with it) — no surface here measures usefulness;
- round 2's kept transcripts carry **no thinking blocks** (measured: 0
  characters across all 30), so ``voiced`` is a floor on what was read rather
  than a measure of it.  A round that wants the reasoning surface has to keep
  it.

Counts, never percentages — N = 30 across 15 condition×model cells.

The token vocabulary is quoted from the live schemas (``FIELD_TOKENS``,
``ActionKind``), never invented here: a renamed field must break this module
loudly rather than count zero for ever — the derived-flag rot of WP-1037, one
directory over.

Usage::

    python -m tests.eval_report_agent.mine_transcripts eval-runs/2026-08-13-round2
    python -m tests.eval_report_agent.mine_transcripts RECORD --json mined.json

The record is gitignored and may simply be absent (``eval-runs/README.md``):
that is reported as a message and exit 2, never a traceback.
