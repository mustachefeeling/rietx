"""Workspace builder for the python-capable arm (PROTOCOL.md 2.0, WP-1064).

The arm answers report-vs-tools-vs-package empirically: the agent gets the
**whole** python surface and the **whole** manual, and the usage mining
(``mine_transcripts``) records which pulls it reached for.  One arm — there
is deliberately no report-off python arm; a crippled package tests a package
nobody ships.

Each workspace ``<workspace_dir>/<eid>/`` holds:

- ``episode.json`` — the identical fixed request core the JSON arms get
  (pydantic JSON round-trip *is* the library-native form; the agent loads it
  through the schemas and drives the package directly — no shim);
- ``AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`` — the manual, **verbatim and complete**, in *every*
  python cell: it ships with the package, so it is part of the surface being
  tested, never a treatment;
- ``prompt.md`` — the v2 answer contract plus ``final_result.json``, the
  workspace rules and the budget.

There is **no condition marker and no shim**: the condition audit is N/A in
this arm by design, and the enforcement that remains — read nothing outside
the workspace, no network, the script-run cap — is the transcript audit's
(PROTOCOL.md 2.0 § Audit; the mining fields are in ``mine_transcripts``).

Two placement rules are structural, not advisory, and both are verified
rather than assumed:

- the **workspace lives outside the repo tree** — "no repo checkout
  reachable" starts with not building the workspace inside one;
- rietx is installed **non-editable into a venv outside the repo tree**,
  and the check is where imports *resolve*, not how the install was spelled
  — the worktree-venv lesson (tests/CLAUDE.md § Quoting numbers): a venv
  whose ``rietx`` resolves into a checkout measures the tree, not the
  package.

Usage::

    python -m tests.eval_report_agent.python_arm \\
        --workspace ~/eval-ws/python__sonnet --truth TRUTH \\
        --venv ~/eval-venvs/rietx-eval --only N1 C1 W1 W2

# Episode {eid} — powder XRD refinement (python)

You are operating the `rietx` Rietveld refinement package directly, as an
installed python library, through this interpreter:

    {python}

This directory is your workspace.  **Work only inside it**: read no other
path on this machine, and do not use the network — the session is audited,
and a transcript that reaches outside invalidates the run.

- `episode.json` — the fixed inputs (structure, instrument, pattern), as the
  package's own JSON schemas.  It is mostly bulk pattern arrays — do not
  read it whole; load it through the schemas:

      import json
      import rietx as rx

      ep = json.load(open("episode.json"))
      structure = rx.Structure.model_validate(ep["structure"])
      instrument = rx.Instrument.model_validate(ep["instrument"])
      data = rx.PatternData.model_validate(ep["pattern"])

  `ep["mode"]` is the refinement mode; if `ep` carries `"two_theta_limits"`,
  pass it to `fit`.  These inputs are the episode: the pattern is fixed, and
  the models are your starting point.  How you refine — plans, stages, what
  you free or hold, model corrections you have evidence for — is yours.
- `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` — the package's operator manual, verbatim and
  complete.
- Budget: plan on at most 6 fit-bearing script runs — a script run counts
  once however many fits it performs; the hard cap is {max_runs}, enforced
  by the session audit.  Run at least one fit — an answer with no
  refinement behind it scores zero.
{deliverable_section}
When you are done, write two files in this directory.

`final_result.json` — the `RefinementResult` you stand behind, exactly as
the package serialises it:

    from pathlib import Path
    Path("final_result.json").write_text(result.model_dump_json())

`answer.json`:

    {{"verdict": "<one of the five below>",
      "next_action": "<one of the seven below>",
      "summary": "<a few sentences: what you concluded and why>"}}

Verdict meanings — pick exactly one:

{verdict_glossary}

Next-action meanings — the single best next step, pick exactly one:

{next_action_glossary}

Work from the numbers.  A good fit is necessary but not sufficient:
parameters compensating for each other can look converged, so prefer the
verdict the evidence supports over the one that ends the episode.
