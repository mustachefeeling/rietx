"""Build the round-3 eval episode fixtures and their scorer-side truth tree.

Protocol 2.0 (WP-1064): every expected answer is a **measurement made before
registration** (PROTOCOL.md § Episodes carries the rows; the landing states
are pinned by ``test_landing_states.py``).  Nine episodes in four dataset
groups, each group built only when asked for:

- synthetic (``E1``, ``E8p``, ``J1P``/``J1S``) — WP-1052's ``_truth()`` and
  the WP-1057 pore proxy, cheap;
- real SRM 660c (``N1``, ``C1``, ``R2``) — cost one ~1.5 s baseline fit;
- real 11-BM NAC (``W1``) — 59.5k channels, so a multi-MB ``episode.json``
  and ~1.5 s fits; no fit at build;
- real IUCr CPD qarr (``W2``) — the Cu Kα doublet data under a deliberately
  single-line source declaration; no fit at build.

Each episode dir holds the fixed request core (``episode.json``:
task/structure/instrument/pattern, pydantic round-trip by design) and the
prompt (``prompt.md``).  The condition marker is a **sibling of the episode
dir** (``<eid>.condition.json``), not a member: the workspace must carry no
condition bit, or an ``ls`` tells an ``off`` agent it is in a withholding
experiment (the round-2 leak, PROTOCOL.md 2.0 § Conditions).  Ground truth —
planted path, tolerance, expected verdict, the registered ``next_action``
set, the declared deliverable — goes to a **separate** tree the agent is
never pointed at.

Usage::

    python -m tests.eval_report_agent.build_fixtures \
        --episodes DIR --truth DIR --condition report --only N1 C1 W1 W2

#: axis all move at once — measured epistemic rows, ``next_action`` +
#: ``assumption_wrong``, the python arm, the condition marker out of the
#: workspace — so a 2.0 run is poolable with nothing earlier, ``off``
#: included (the v2 answer contract is in every prompt).
#: 2.1 (WP-1065): prompt content only — ``assumption_wrong`` stops naming
#: refinable geometry (round 3's ``off__sonnet``/C1 recovered the knocked
#: displacement and then answered ``assumption_wrong``, invited by "the

#: under test carries THRESHOLDS_VERSION 0.9's license sentence.  Episode
#: fixtures, answer schema and scorer v2 are unchanged, so landing-state
#: bands hold — but prompts changed, so a 2.1 cell pools with nothing at 2.0.
#: 2.2 (WP-1107): answer contract v3 — ``report_with_caveat`` leaves
#: ``next_action`` (the WP-1107 archaeology: the one delivery-stance token in
#: a remedial vocabulary, an unfalsifiable hedge sink on real data) and the
#: unscored ``caveats`` list takes the delivery stance; the
#: ``assumption_wrong`` exclusion names both target verdicts with equal
#: weight (2.1's "converge it, or say the data cannot" is the N=1 suspect
#: for all four ``off`` verdicts flipping to ``converged``); two shim
#: projections land (``license_placement``, ``include_execution``, both

# Episode {eid} — powder XRD refinement

You are operating the `rietx` Rietveld refinement package through one JSON
call, the shim command below.  This directory is your workspace:

- `episode.json` — the fixed request core (structure, instrument, pattern).
  Read-only: the shim merges your overlay onto it; you never edit it.  It is
  mostly bulk pattern arrays — do not read it whole; if you need a metadata
  field (phase, wavelength), query it selectively (e.g. `jq`/`head`).
- `overlay.json` — yours to write.  Allowed keys, each optional:
  - `"plan"`: a preset name, or an explicit stage list
    `{{"stages": [{{"name": "...", "turn_on": ["<path glob>", ...]}}, ...]}}`
    (stages accumulate: each stage frees its `turn_on` globs on top of the
    previous stages' — dot-paths like `instrument.zero_shift`,
    `phases.*.cell.*`).  Omitted = the `mccusker_default` preset.
  - `"mode"`: `"rietveld"` (default) | `"lebail"` | `"pawley"`.
  - `"two_theta_limits"`: `[lo, hi]` — fit only this range (legitimate for
    excluding a contaminated region; the exclusion is recorded).
  Any other key is refused by the shim.
- To run one refinement — every call starts from the same fixed starting
  values; calls do not chain — run, from the repository root:

      {python} -m tests.eval_report_agent.run_refine {episode_dir}

  The response prints to stdout (bulk curve arrays elided; every parameter,
  statistic and diagnostic{report_clause} is intact) and is appended to
  `calls.jsonl`.  A call usually returns in seconds, but a refinement that
  diverges can take 2-3 minutes before it fails — allow a 5-minute timeout.
  A failed call returns `{{"ok": false, "error": ...}}`; that is information,
  not a harness bug.
- Budget: plan on at most 6 calls; the shim hard-stops at {max_calls}.  Make
  at least one call — an answer with no refinement behind it scores zero.
{deliverable_section}
When you are done, write `answer.json` in this directory:

    {{"verdict": "<one of the five below>",
      "next_action": "<one of the six below>",
      "caveats": ["<zero or more short statements of limitations you would
                   attach to the delivered result>"],
      "summary": "<a few sentences: what you concluded and why>"}}

Verdict meanings — pick exactly one:

{verdict_glossary}

Next-action meanings — the single best next step, pick exactly one:

{next_action_glossary}

Work from the numbers in the response.  A good fit is necessary but not
sufficient: parameters compensating for each other can look converged, so
prefer the verdict the evidence supports over the one that ends the episode.
