"""v1.3 cross-engine acceptance: the two PowderLine recipes (WP-1306).

Every other acceptance suite in this directory has **one** reference.  This one
has two, GSAS-II and TOPAS, both committed by upstream for the same specimens —
and that turns out to be the whole point of it, because on the two-phase
DRX_33 cathode **the two references disagree by 2 665 ppm on the cubic cell**.
No answer can be within the ±300 ppm the FAP suite uses of both, so the bar
here is the *envelope* the two engines span, widened by that same ±300 ppm at
each end.  It still fails on a translation error, which is what it is for; it
does not assert an agreement neither reference achieves.

The disagreement is upstream's own and it is documented there: GSAS-II reports
two soft (SVD) Hessian singularities on this recipe and a 100 % correlation
between each phase's ``Mustrain;mx`` and ``Mustrain;i``, then returns a
**negative** crystallite size for the monoclinic phase, while TOPAS returns
5×10⁸ µm — no size broadening at all.  ``tests/data/README.md`` § v1.3 has the
full table.  What this suite measures is where this package lands in that
argument, and the answer is close to TOPAS: **11-93 ppm on all five free cell
parameters**, at Rwp 7.333 % against TOPAS's 7.326 %, while sitting the same
1 004-2 575 ppm from GSAS-II that TOPAS does.

LaB6 is the other kind of fixture — an instrument-profile calibration with the
SRM cell **held**, so there is no cell to compare and the check is the profile
itself: this fit's drawn peak widths against the widths GSAS-II's own
``y_calc`` shows, reflection by reflection.  Three model differences are stated
rather than fitted around, and together they are why the Rwp is 8.86 % against
GSAS-II's 6.53 % (and beside TOPAS's 8.52 %):

1. GSAS-II's ``Z``, a constant Lorentzian term, has no counterpart here.
2. Its refined ``Y`` is **negative** (−15.81 centideg; TOPAS's is −8.97), and
   this package's Lorentzian coefficients are softplus-bounded because a width
   is not a shape when it is negative.  With Y negative GSAS-II's total gamma
   goes negative above ~6.5 °2θ and is clamped at its 0.001 centideg floor, so
   **26 of its 49 reflections carry no Lorentzian at all** — a shape a monotone
   width cannot make (measured in ``test_recipe.py``).
3. The recipe leaves the size/strain magnitudes null, which GSAS-II fills with
   its own project defaults of 1 µm and 1000 microstrain — 0.057°·tanθ, a
   quarter of the peak width at the top of the range.  Another engine's project
   default is not adopted here; it is reported (``RECIPE_ENGINE_DEFAULT_DECLINED``).

Given all three, the widths agreeing to a **median 1.2 %** is the result, and
it is what this suite asserts.
