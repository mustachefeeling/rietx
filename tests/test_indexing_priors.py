"""WP-1045 — analogue priors steer the search and never gate it.

The three rules of ``indexing/priors.py``, each pinned: a prior reorders and
seeds (its system jumps the queue, its metric seeds the stochastic engine)
and never injects a candidate past the engines; it narrows *order*, never the
box; and a prior used is recorded (``INDEX_PRIOR_USED``).  The acceptance
sentence is tested literally: a poisoned prior costs time, never truth.
