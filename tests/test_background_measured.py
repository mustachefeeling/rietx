"""A measured background: the scale, its esds, and the four ways it goes wrong.

:class:`~rietx.schemas.instrument.BackgroundFixedPlusChebyshev` held a curve and
added it with an implicit coefficient of exactly 1.0, which is TOPAS's
``bkg_file("f.xy")`` and only that form.  WP-1309 adds the other one,
``bkg_file("f.xy", @, s)``, and every test here exists because one step of that
can be wrong in a way nothing else would notice:

* a curve carried **twice** — as the frozen ``fixed_background`` term and as a
  design row — is absorbed by the refined scale as ``s_true − 1``, leaves Rwp
  bit-for-bit unchanged, and is wrong only in the number the caller asked for;
* a scale outside ``bkg_paths`` falls to the finite-difference fallback, which
  is still correct and rebuilds the profile derivative bases every iteration;
* a scale the stage cannot move must be folded into the frozen curve, where 1.0
  is exactly the identity, or every number a project produced before this field
  existed moves by an ulp for nothing;
* and a curve that does not cover the pattern was extrapolated by ``np.interp``
  silently, which is counts nobody measured.

The fixture here is **synthetic**, and deliberately so: it is built at a known
scale, so it can ask whether the machinery recovers a number rather than whether
a number is plausible.  The **real** blank arrived on 2026-09-17 and is
`tests/data/11BM_Kapton.xy`; issue #171's own measurements are checked against
it in `test_acceptance_si640c.py`'s blank arms, which is also where the
synthetic findings below are corroborated on data nobody built — the recovered
scale is biased low by the same regression dilution, and a longer polynomial
eats it the same way.
