"""The aberrations a geometry has and could not express.

The condition is keyed on the *geometry* (a Debye-Scherrer capillary with no
goniometer radius), not on the radiation, so the fire and silence cases build
``Instrument.debye_scherrer`` — an X-ray capillary that stands on ``main`` with
no dependency on the neutron source.  One neutron case is kept, on the BT-1
instrument that motivated the diagnostic, to hold that the same geometry reached
through ``constant_wavelength_neutron`` reads the same gate.
