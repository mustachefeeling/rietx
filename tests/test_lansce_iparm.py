"""The legacy LANSCE ``.iparm`` bolt-on, :func:`rietx.io.legacy.read_lansce_iparm`.

Synthetic files written column by column with the strict reader's own fixture
helpers (``tests/test_instrument_tof.py``), so a record here is laid out
exactly as a spec-legal one is and differs only by the deviation under test.
The one real fixture is the NPDF run 7245 calibration's instrument records,
``tests/data/tof/npdf_7245_instrument.iparm`` (its header carries the
provenance; ``tests/data/README.md`` the licence finding).  The slot destinations and the fifth-pair
exponent these tests pin were measured against GSAS-II v5.8.2 run as a black
box; the run is recorded in the module docstring of
:mod:`rietx.io.legacy.lansce_iparm`, and GSAS-II is not needed to run them.
