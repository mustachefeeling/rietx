"""Guards on the validation matrix — fast, so they are paid per push.

The matrix (``tests/validation_matrix.py``) is only worth having if it cannot
drift from the suites it describes.  The failure mode it exists to prevent is
specific and has already happened once in this repo: README's validation
section said "eight acceptance suites" while nine were committed, because the
table was maintained by hand and nothing checked it.

So: the registry and the acceptance tree are held in **bijection** by AST
collection (not by import, which a decorator or a module-level fixture could
satisfy without a real test existing), tiers come from a closed vocabulary,
and ``docs/VALIDATION.md`` is asserted byte-identical to its regeneration.
Adding an acceptance test without a matrix row fails here, in ~50 ms, rather
than being noticed a milestone later.
