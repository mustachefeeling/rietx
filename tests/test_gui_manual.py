"""The GUI chapters' anti-divergence guards (WP-1017).

Part 2 is guarded by injected constants, Part 1 by name resolution
(`test_manual.py`, `test_manual_api.py`).  A GUI chapter is guarded by neither,
because its subject is routes and panels rather than importable names — and the
prose-drift problem is worse here than anywhere else in the manual: this WP's
own mailbox recorded "three sentences in this chapter are now wrong" eight
times over eight sessions, each time because a control moved.

So the two vocabularies a GUI chapter is *about* are partitioned the way
`tests/api_surface.py` partitions the call surface:

* every route in the server's table is named in a GUI chapter or excluded with
  a written reason — a new route fails this until one or the other is true;
* every tab in the live tab strip is named in a GUI chapter, the strip arriving
  as a committed corpus that vitest writes from the app's own `TABS`
  (`tests/data/gui/panels.json`, the `test_gui_fnmatch.py` mechanism with the
  authorities swapped: TypeScript owns the strip, python proves the manual
  states it).

What this does not measure is whether the sentence about a route is *true*.
The bar for that is review and the screenshots; this stops a route or a panel
from being silently forgotten.
