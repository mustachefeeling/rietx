"""Frozen evaluation windows on a flight-time bank, sized by the tail.

The back-to-back-exponential peak is **asymmetric**, and its asymmetry is a
function of α and β — the very coefficients a stage refines.  So a window that
discards a fixed fraction of the *area* discards a fraction that moves between
candidate solutions, and a window frozen for the stage turns that into a term
in χ² that depends on where the model was compiled rather than on where it is.
Measured on a real bank at 2 %
it was worth 42 χ² units in 1941 — enough to move the χ² minimum by eleven of
its own σ and to score an uphill step as downhill.

The rule here is a **per-side, per-component** discarded fraction,
``TOF_WINDOW_AREA_TOL``, with the exponential wings sized as −ln(tol)
e-foldings and the resolution function to the same fraction on each side.  The
two extents are *added*, which is a bound rather than an approximation: the
profile is a convolution, so ``P(E + R > h_E + h_R) ≤ P(E > h_E) + P(R > h_R)``.

**Every fixture here is synthetic.**  The real bank's numbers are in the rung's
report.
