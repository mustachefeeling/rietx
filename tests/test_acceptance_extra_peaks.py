"""v1.4 acceptance: a declared sharp peak on real data (WP-1103).

The design case, measured end to end rather than asserted. A sample holder
diffracting at its own specimen distance puts sharp lines where no phase in the
model has one, and the lines **overlap peaks that matter** — which is the only
case where a `PeakComponent` earns its place, because an intruder in empty
background can simply be excluded at no cost.

The fixture is the NIST SRM 660c LaB6 protocol of
`test_acceptance_srm660c.py` — real CuKα divergent-beam data with a reference
cell — contaminated by injecting a two-line holder doublet onto two LaB6
reflections. The intruder is synthetic because no committed standard carries a
holder line; the *pattern it is injected into* is real, which is what the cell
bias has to be measured against.

Three arms on the same contaminated data:

* **ignore** — refine as if the intruder were not there. The phases absorb it.
* **declare** — two `PeakComponent`s, freed in their own stage.
* **exclude** — `excluded_regions` over both intruders, the alternative a
  caller reaches for today.

and the **clean** arm (the uncontaminated pattern) is the truth all three are
measured against. The package recommends through evidence: the excluded-regions
arm is *quoted*, never gated, and its lost-channel count is quoted beside it,
because whether losing those channels matters is the caller's question.

Measured (2026-09-13, macOS darwin 25.5.0, `[dev]`), two holder lines of area
120 counts·deg and FWHM 0.16° injected onto the LaB6 reflections at 37.4418°
and 43.6205°:

    arm         a (Å)        esd        ppm      Rwp      channels
    clean       4.156895     2.49e-05     0.0    0.08671      5332
    ignore      4.156927     1.88e-04    +7.6    0.31714      5332
    declare     4.156891     2.46e-05    -1.0    0.07701      5332
    exclude     4.156898     2.49e-05    +0.6    0.08625      5076

**The honest reading, and it is not the one this WP assumed.** Declaring
recovers the clean cell (-1.0 ppm) and ignoring does not (+7.6 ppm, with the
esd inflated 7.5x and Rwp 3.7x) — that part holds. But *excluding also
recovers it*, to +0.6 ppm, for 256 channels (4.8 %). On this fixture the case
for declaring is **not** cell accuracy over exclusion. It is that the channels
stay in the fit, and that the intruder is measured rather than discarded:
areas 123.4(43) and 124.5(24) against a truth of 120, centres within 0.005°.

Where exclusion would cost more is where LaB6 costs least — a pattern with few
reflections, or a series whose trajectory needs every one of them. That is the
operando case this member was designed for, and this fixture is not it. Said
here rather than left for a reader to infer from a row that looks like a win.

`EXTRA_PEAK_ON_REFLECTION` fires twice on the declare arm, which is correct:
the lines were injected *onto* reflections, so the intensity split between
phase and component is exactly the degeneracy that diagnostic names. The
slightly-high recovered areas (both ~1-2σ above truth) are that degeneracy
being real, not the fit being wrong.

This module pins the orderings that make the feature worth having, not the
digits.
