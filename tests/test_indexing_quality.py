"""WP-1019 — the data-quality gate and the systematic-shift model.

Two things are being tested, and they are asymmetric on purpose.

The **gate** must abstain rather than hand a search data that cannot support
one — the same move Layer 1's maturity gate makes one rank down, and the
assertions are about *refusal*, not about accuracy.

The **shift screen** must name the physical cause when the angular range makes
the three causes separable, and must **decline to name one** when it does not,
while still measuring the magnitude.  That second half is the point: a
zero-point error, a displaced specimen and a transparent specimen are three
different physical faults with three different angular dependences, and every
program the 2004 benchmark paper surveys fits one constant "zeropoint" instead.
Naming the wrong cause is worse than naming none, because the correction is
applied to the wrong part of the instrument.

    This WP's plan said a dominant zone and a dominant row are "detectable in
    Q-space before any search".  They are not: a dominant zone is the statement
    that the low-angle lines satisfy a *two-dimensional* quadratic form, and a
    dominant row is an arithmetic progression k²B among the low Q values — each
    is a search, not a census.  The obvious census (Ito's most-repeated Q
    difference) was implemented and measured, and scored dominant-zone cells at
    +0.9σ and +0.8σ against a permutation null while scoring a *general*
    monoclinic cell at +3.3σ; against a uniform null a **cubic** list scores
    +15.6σ, because Q = A(h²+k²+l²) makes every difference a multiple of A.  So
    the report carries no such field and no ``INDEX_DOMINANT_ZONE`` code, and the
    detection is owed to the engines (WP-1021/1022) where a candidate zone exists.
