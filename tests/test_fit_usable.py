"""WP-1336: the fit says when it is unusable (issues #243 and #249).

Two channels, each owed a test.  ``status`` is the optimiser's exit and
``diagnostics`` is the quality channel, and ``RefinementResult.usable`` reads
both — so the #243 reproduction, which converges at an Rwp past
``MODEL_FAR_FROM_DATA``, must read ``usable is False`` while its ``status``
still says ``converged``.  And the indexing width census now runs on the fit:
a broad pattern fitted with a narrow declared instrument and no size or strain
terms names the width with ``PEAK_WIDTH_LAW_MISMATCH``, and the same pattern
with the size term freed does not.
