"""``pick_peaks`` on a background the envelope cannot follow: lines that are not there.

Forward-modelled silicon (Cu Kα1 + Kα2, pseudo-Voigt lines, Poisson noise,
numpy and gemmi's IT92 form factors only, no measured data) on two backgrounds.
Silicon has no reflection below 28.4° 2θ, so any usable "line" below 28° is
false.  On the gentle background there is none.  On a sigmoid fall, 2300 → 800
counts over 11–22°, the 3° rolling-10th-percentile envelope under-tracks the
curvature, the net above it clears detection's 5σ, and the fit returns
components whose intensity is a third of their own esd.  They were offered to
every indexing engine as evidence of a lattice and ``index_pattern`` returned no
cubic cell, while the same pattern cropped above the flank returned the F cell.

The fix is in the flag, not the envelope: a component whose intensity is under
``PEAK_NO_INTENSITY_SIGMA`` of its own esd is ``no_intensity`` and unusable.
