"""WP-1210 — the GUI's colours, held apart in OKLab.

Since WP-1429 the values are :data:`rietx.viz.theme.TOKENS` — Python, because
``rietx watch`` and ``rietx compare`` ship inside the wheel and the GUI
workspace does not, and the three pages a reader has open at once must not
answer "which colour is the calculated curve" three ways.  ``gui/src/tokens.css``
is generated from them and committed, and the byte-equality test below holds the
two together, so an edit on either side fails until the other follows.  Every
other assertion here reads the module, which is the authority.

The distance that decides whether two of them are one colour is
:func:`rietx.gui.structure3d._oklab_distance`, which the phase palette already
uses.  So the assertion is here, in Python, rather than in ``plot.test.ts``: a
TypeScript port would be a second answer to "how far apart are these two
colours", and this repo has paid for that shape before.  What the vitest side
asserts is the *plumbing* — that ``curveColors`` reads each property and falls
back per property.

Why it is worth asserting at all: before this WP the peak layer had no colours
of its own, and the two it borrowed were `--plot-diff` and `--plot-calc`
**exactly** on the light theme.  Nothing failed; the picture simply drew the
picked-peak fit and the model in one red.

WP-1217 added the history graph's lanes at the bottom, which are the same
question about a different set: the rail is where two marks of one shape and
one weight mean different things, so following a line is the whole job.

#: The recessive set, exempt from the floor **against each other only**.
#:
#: `viz/theme.py` says why: observations and background are meant to sit below the

#: the mark — points against a dotted line.  Measured, obs/bkg is 0.086 on the
#: light theme, so a blanket all-pairs assertion would be asserting the opposite
#: of the design.
#:
#: `--muted` belongs here for a second reason worth stating, because a reviewer
#: has already flagged it once: it draws the **masked measured points**, which
#: are the same data as `--plot-obs` and are meant to read that way (WP-1033) —
#: 0.032 apart on the dark theme.  What may *not* borrow it is a mark that is
#: not the data: WP-1210 briefly drew unusable peak markers in it, sitting on

#: colour with the hollow ring carrying the state.

#: **0.129** and dark `--plot-obs`/`--plot-diff` is **0.124**, against a 0.13
#: floor.  Retuning a shipped curve colour is not WP-1210's — the layer that had
#: no colours at all is — but they may not get *worse* either, which is what
#: :data:`GRANDFATHERED_FLOOR` holds them to.  A third such pair fails.
