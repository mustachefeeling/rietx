"""``structure_from_cif`` names the fault in a malformed file.

gemmi stops on a malformed CIF with ``file:line:col: parse error`` and no
cause, and reads a number it cannot parse as NaN, which then reached the
schema as "value nan lies outside bounds" with no file, tag or value.  The
2026-10-06 MAGNDATA sweep found 70 files stopped by a bare parse error and 3 by
the NaN; every one was malformed, and each kind below is one of them,
reproduced on a hand-written file.  Each test states the edit that fixes the
file, so the message is checked for naming *that*, and the file is checked to
read once the edit is made (the positive arm: the fault named is the fault).
