"""``SequentialRefinement`` had no per-pattern exception handling: an uncaught
exception anywhere inside ``_chain`` — deterministic on a genuinely
near-singular warm-carried block, ``numpy.linalg.LinAlgError: SVD did not
converge`` in the trigger case — propagated straight through ``fit()`` and
lost the *entire* chain, including every already-converged earlier pattern.
``on_result`` (a per-pattern callback) had already seen those results; only
the series' own aggregated state (``results_``, ``trees_``, the returned
``SeriesResult``) was empty afterwards.

This is a different failure from ``SeriesEntry.status == "diverged"``: a
diverged fit is a *result* (converged somewhere the reseed fence rejects) and
the WP-1051 quarantine already carries the chain through it with no policy
needed. This module is about a fit that never returns at all.

Reproduction: eight synthetic LaB6 patterns (``tests/test_refine_synthetic``'s
own synthesis routine, reused rather than re-derived), one of which is made
to raise via a monkeypatched ``Refinement.fit`` — the cleanest way to inject a
deterministic, position-independent failure without needing a genuinely
near-singular parameterisation on toy data (the brief's own suggested
alternative). The exception type and message match the real trigger
(``LinAlgError: SVD did not converge for slice = 0``); nothing about *which*
pattern fails or *why* is data from the private series that surfaced this.
