/** WP-1203 — the help corpus, resolved and placed.
 *
 * `rietx.help` is the one authority for what a name in this package means
 * (root CLAUDE.md), served whole by `GET /api/help`.  This module is the
 * client half: it turns a key into an entry, and an anchor rectangle into a
 * position.  Both are pure functions, deliberately — a popover positioned from
 * `getBoundingClientRect` measures zero under jsdom, so the arithmetic is
 * asserted on numbers here rather than on a layout no test environment has.
 *
 * **A key is `arm:name` and never a bare name.**  The arms have overlapping
 * vocabularies — `seed` is a stage field *and* a search control, `preset` is a
 * search control *and* a plan's own word — so a bare key would resolve by
 * declaration order, which is exactly the property `help_key_for`'s
 * exactly-one-family test exists to avoid one rank down.  `parameters` is the
 * one arm whose name is a glob (`phases.*.cell.a`), which is what
 * `ParameterRow.help_key` carries, so a row's key is
 * `parameters:${row.help_key}`.
 *
 * `help.test.ts` replays the committed corpus `tests/data/gui/help_keys.json`,
 * written from the live registry by `tests/test_gui_help.py` — the fnmatch
 * mechanism (python owns the vocabulary, TypeScript proves it can state it) —
 * and every `<Help for=…>` in the app is crossed against it there.
