 * controls. That also settles something the box could not do: under
 * `hovermode: "x unified"` plotly snaps *every* trace to its nearest point in
 * x, so the candidate overlay would have put a row in the box at every pointer
 * position, which is why WP-1211 gave it `hoverinfo: "skip"` and left its
 * served `hkl` undrawn. Here it is one more row.
 *
 * Pure, and every value is formatted here rather than in the component, because
 * what makes a readout right is that it reads as the table beside it reads:
 * `formatPosition`/`formatIntensity` are `lib/peaks.ts`' (WP-1209), and the
 * intensities are `formatValue`'s six significant figures — which is what the
 * deleted `hovertemplate`s printed, `%{customdata:.6g}` over the **unscaled**
 * value, so a √ view still reads in intensity.
 *
 * A row a payload cannot fill is **absent, not empty**: there is a row per
 * curve that is *drawn*, which makes the strip's shape a property of the
 * payload, the tab and the curve toggles — never of where the pointer happens
 * to be. Everything that varies with the pointer keeps its slot and empties it
 * instead: the three "nearest something" rows, and `x === null` for the pointer
 * being off the plot altogether, which is most of the time. A strip that grew a
 * field on hover would resize the canvas above it once per entry, and that is
 * the jitter WP-1212 spent itself removing, arriving through the repair for it.
 *
 * Two questions, two positions, and they are not the same one. What a *curve*
 * says is the nearest drawn channel's, and the position printed is that
 * channel's, so every number belongs to one measured point and the tick offsets
 * are consistent with it. What is *near the pointer* — a picked line, a
 * predicted one — is hit-tested against the pointer's own `x`, because a drawn
 * pattern is decimated and the channel it snapped to can be further away than
 * the tolerance being applied.
 *
 * The one place this reads two arms is the **masked** channels: they are in no
 * result, so they arrive beside it (WP-1033), and a pointer inside an excluded
 * region is over one of them. The nearest channel is therefore taken over both
 * arms, and a masked one has no model to quote — which is also how the strip
 * says where the pointer is, without a field that changes width to say it.
