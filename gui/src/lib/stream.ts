/** The event stream's bookkeeping, as pure functions so it can be unit-tested.
 *
 * `/api/events` multiplexes two SSE frame types over one connection:
 *
 *   * `event: event` — an engine event dict (`fit_start`, `stage_start`, `eval`,
 *     `stage_end`, `fit_end`), carrying `seq` and an **open** `data` object;
 *   * `event: state` — the session's run state, which exists because a *failed*
 *     fit emits no `fit_end`: a follower watching engine events alone would hang
 *     on exactly the case it most needs to report.
 *
 * Two rules are encoded here rather than left to each caller.  Event `data` is
 * read field by field with `?.` — the contract says fields are additive, so
 * destructuring a fixed shape is what breaks on the next release.  And the
 * `seq` cursor can genuinely fall behind: the server's ring holds 4096 events
 * and a staged fit emits one per residual evaluation, so `oldest` is compared
 * against the cursor and a real gap is *reported*, never silently renumbered.
