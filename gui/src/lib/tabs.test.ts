/** The panel strip, written out for the manual to be held to (WP-1017).
 *
 * The `fnmatch`/`controls` mechanism with the authorities swapped. There,
 * python owns the vocabulary and TypeScript replays a committed corpus to
 * prove the form states it. Here the tab strip is the *app's* — no python
 * object knows the panels exist — so this side writes the corpus and
 * `tests/test_gui_manual.py` reads it, failing when a GUI chapter does not
 * name a tab.
 *
 * Writing rather than asserting is deliberate: a renamed panel should update
 * the corpus and fail the *manual*, which is the file that is now wrong. A
 * committed corpus also keeps the python suite node-free, the same property
 * `test_gui_dist.py` protects for the built dist.
