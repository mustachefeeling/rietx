/**
 * Rendering the symmetry the server serves (WP-1035).
 *
 * Every function here is a **formatter**.  Nothing computes a tie, a Laue class,
 * a site symmetry or a compatibility verdict: those come off `GET /api/structure`'s
 * `symmetry`/`causes` arms, `GET /api/structure/symmetry`, and the preview verb,
 * all of which read the same `cell_constraints` / `stabilizer_rotations` /
 * `ParameterTable` the refinement itself reads.  A second copy of the crystal
 * systems in TypeScript is exactly the thing WP-1014's split exists to prevent,
 * and WP-1036's measurement is why: 79 of gemmi's 564 settings were served wrong
 * under a *correct* free-parameter count, so a client that "knew" the rule would
 * be wrong in a way no count could catch.
 *
 * They live here rather than in `Model.svelte` so they can be asserted without a
 * DOM, which is the same reason `table.ts` and `fnmatch.ts` do.
