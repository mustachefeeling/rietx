/** The text pane's state machine — framework-free, so it can be asserted.
 *
 * The server session is the single source of truth and the pane is a dirty
 * buffer over one of its renderings. Four rules, all of them WP-1009's rather
 * than this pane's:
 *
 * **A render never clobbers an edit.** `GET /api/textdoc` is re-read whenever the
 * head moves — a run, a checkout, a form edit, an applied suggestion — and if the
 * buffer is dirty the new rendering is *not* adopted: the pane goes
 * {@link SyncState.stale} and says so. Adopting would delete work the user can
 * see on screen.
 *
 * **There is no merge.** The document is regenerated from state, so a three-way
 * merge would be merging two renderings of one authority. A stale pane offers
 * exactly one resolution — re-read and re-apply — and that is also what the
 * server's `STALE_REVISION` 409 means, so the two paths land in the same place.
 *
 * **Only the server decides validity.** Every {@link SyncState.problems} entry
 * arrives from a `PUT` response; nothing here inspects the text. `lib/pxt.ts`
 * colours it and has no `error` token to emit.
 *
 * **A response from an older buffer is dropped.** Validation is debounced, so
 * two requests can be in flight across one pause in typing and they can land out
 * of order. Every edit bumps {@link SyncState.seq}; a response carrying an older
 * one is ignored rather than painting squiggles at line numbers that have moved.
