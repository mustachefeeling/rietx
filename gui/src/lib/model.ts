/** Structure and instrument editing, as pure functions (WP-1014).
 *
 * The founding rule here is a split, and it is the one that keeps this editor
 * from becoming a second parameter table: **if the parameter table has the path,
 * the parameter table owns it.**  A cell edge, an occupancy, a profile term, a
 * coordinate DOF — all of those are rows in `GET /api/params`, so this editor
 * sends them through `PATCH /api/params`, where the tie/lock/mode rules and the
 * bounds already live and where the refusal is the verb's own words.  What is
 * left for `PATCH /api/structure` / `PATCH /api/instrument` is everything that is
 * *not* a number in θ: a species, a label, an atom added or removed, a geometry
 * declared, a wavelength, a background family.  Those change what the parameter
 * table *contains*, which is exactly why the model routes take a whole validated
 * model rather than a field patch (WP-1008).
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because they look like limitations and are the
 * design.  A coordinate is never typed as x/y/z: `x` is an affine tie onto
 * `…dof.k` and typing into it is refused by name, so the editor offers the DOFs
 * and a site-symmetry violation is *unrepresentable* rather than caught.  And a
 * cell edge on a cubic phase refuses with "follows … as an affine tie" — the same
 * sentence the text pane and the parameter grid show, because it is the same call.
 *
 * The delta is computed against a **freshly read** model, not the one on screen —
 * WP-1009's rule, third outing.  A whole-model PATCH built from a stale read
 * would silently revert every field it did not touch.

/** The phase's own numbers: the scale, and the sample broadening beside it.
 *
 * Sample broadening is the phase's half of the instrument ⊕ sample split, and
 * the reason it is here rather than left to the parameter table is the whole of
 * WP-1214: it is the family a crystallographer most often frees by hand, and
 * `instrument.profile.u` is already two columns away on the same screen.
 * Gaussian *variances* add and Lorentzian *FWHMs* do, which is why the two
 * pairs carry different units.
 *
 * The phase's corrections (extinction, preferred orientation, the Stephens
 * block) are **not** here: each is declared per phase rather than always
 * present, so offering one is offering to declare it, and that is a model edit
 * this form does not make.
