/** The FitReport panel's logic — what to show, in what order, and how honestly.
 *
 * The report's own rule is that it must never return a confident wrong singleton
 * (CLAUDE.md), and a renderer can break that without touching the numbers: by
 * hiding an abstention, by sorting suggestions so a vetoed one looks absent, or by
 * printing a per-report estimate in a per-row column.  So the decisions that could
 * do that live here as functions, with `report.test.ts` asserting them.
 *
 * Every numeric field goes through `num()` from `table.ts`: a gate's Gram
 * condition and a separability ratio are legitimately ±∞, and this package spells
 * a non-finite float as a **string** on the wire because `JSON.parse` rejects
 * Python's bare `Infinity` (WP-1011).  `Number("1e4") > 1e3` is true;
 * `"1e4" > 1e3` is a string comparison that happens to work and then does not.
