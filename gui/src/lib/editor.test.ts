/**
 * The CodeMirror adapter — the three things it must not get wrong.
 *
 * It holds no rules (those are in `sync.ts` and `pxt.ts`), so what is left to
 * assert is the wiring, and each of these is a bug that would be invisible until
 * a user hit it:
 *
 *  * **an echo is not an edit** — `setDoc` writes the server's rendering into the
 *    document, and without a guard CM's own change notification would come back
 *    as "the user typed", so every re-read would mark the buffer dirty and the
 *    pane would go stale against itself;
 *  * **a re-render keeps the caret** — the pane re-reads whenever anything else
 *    in the app moves the head, and replacing the whole document would move the
 *    cursor on every stage a fit completes;
 *  * **a diagnostic lands on the line the server named** — 1-based, per
 *    `textdoc.TextError`, and off-by-one here would squiggle the wrong row.
