  /**
   * The one way this app explains a name (WP-1203).
   *
   * `<Help for="stage_fields:max_iter">iterations</Help>` wraps a term in the
   * `.help` register — WP-1201's cursor-only mark, no glyph and no underline —
   * and a click opens the app's single popover on it.  A second click, Esc or
   * a click away closes it, and focus goes back to the term.
   *
   * It sits beside `App.svelte` rather than in `panels/` because it is not a
   * panel: panels use it.  It declares no styles of its own — the trigger is
   * `.help` and the popover is `.popover`, both in `app.css`, which is where a
   * register's geometry is argued about (`lib/style.test.ts`).
   *
   * Two props, and the pair is the WP's measured rule.  `for` is a corpus key
   * and is what almost every use wants: the sentence lives in `rietx.help`, so
   * the GUI, the CLI and the manual read the same one.  `text` is for a
   * sentence the **server** wrote — `held_because`, a refutation, a maturity
   * message — which no corpus can hold because it is about one row rather than
   * one name.  Those were `title=` attributes until this WP, which put them
   * out of reach of the keyboard the moment WP-1201 moved one off a `<button>`.
   *
   * The trigger is a `<span>` with `role="button"`, not a `<button>`: it wraps
   * running text (a table header, a field's label, a chip's words) and a real
   * button would take the register's fill, weight and padding with it.  What
   * matters is that it is focusable and answers Enter and Space, which it does.
   *
   * **A term is named by its own words, and `label` is the exception.**  It was
   * `aria-label="explain"` by default until a browser pass measured what that
   * does: a name on a term *renames whatever encloses it*.  Accname computes a
   * `<label>`'s or a `<th>`'s name from its contents, and a descendant with an
   * `aria-label` contributes that string instead of its text (accname 1.2 step
   * 2C, and 2E again for the same node read as an embedded control).  So
   * wrapping `zero` in a `<Help>` renamed the instrument editor's input from
   * `zero (°2θ)` to `explain (°2θ)`, the atom table's four column headers to
   * `explain`, and the cell edges to `what a is` — this WP's own subject,
   * inverted, on every labelled field it touched.
   *
   * Hence `label = null`: the term's children are its name, which is what a
   * `<label>` wants anyway, and **`aria-haspopup="dialog"` is what says an
   * explanation opens** — that channel does not take part in a name.  Pass
   * `label` only where the children are a *glyph* (`🔒`, `=`, `·`), which names
   * nothing, and only where no `<label>` or `<th>` encloses the term; there is
   * one such site, and `App.test.ts` fails on a second one that is enclosed.
