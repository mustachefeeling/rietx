"""Stamp ``build-info.json`` beside the committed dist — and define the hash once.

The dist under ``src/pxrdref/gui/static`` is committed so that installing the
wheel never needs node, which creates one hazard: a dist that no longer matches
the sources it was built from.  The guard is a digest of the frontend sources
recorded at build time and re-checked by ``tests/test_gui_dist.py``, which must
run in the ordinary CI path — where there is no node.

So the digest is defined **here, in stdlib Python**, and both sides call it: the
build (``npm run build`` runs this file after vite) and the test (which imports
this file by path).  The WP sketched a JS hasher plus a Python re-implementation;
two implementations of one digest is the duplication this repo keeps paying for
elsewhere, and the only thing the JS version would have bought is not needing
``python3`` on a machine that is building a Python package's frontend.

Nothing time-varying goes in the file.  A build timestamp would make every
rebuild a dist diff, which would destroy the property the digest exists to give:
``git diff --exit-code src/pxrdref/gui/static`` means "the dist is stale", not
"someone ran the build".

Usage (from the ``gui/`` directory)::
